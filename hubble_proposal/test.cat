Title:	    Locating Ultraluminous X-Ray Sources
PI:         Philip Kaaret

We propose to observe ultraluminous X-ray sources which are located near
objects bright both in the X-rays and the optical using Chandra and HST. The
presence of these reference objects will allow us to tie the x-ray and optical
references frames and achieve 0.1-0.2 arcsecond relative position accuracy in
searching for optical counterparts to the ultraluminous x-ray sources. This
will be a significant improvement over the accuracy previously obtained for
most ULXs {limited by Chandra's absolute astrometry} and will should permit
identification of individual counterparts.

Title:	    Detailed Study of X-ray Jets from a Complete Survey
PI:         Eric Perlman

We propose deep followup HST and Chandra observations of two X-ray jets, which
are the X-ray brightest discovered in our Chandra survey of quasars with known
radio jets. With these data, we will compare their X-ray, optical and radio
morphologies. We will also obtain X-ray and optical spectral indices, and
spatially resolved SEDs from the radio through the X-rays. This will allow us
to determine the X-ray emission mechanism at each point in these jets, and
test critical predictions made by each mechanism. We will also be able to
track any changes in physical conditions {including magnetic field and bulk
Lorentz factor} that are present in the observed 90 degree bends.

Title:	    Deep Chandra and Hubble Observations of NGC4697, the Nearest
	    Optically Luminous, X-ray Faint Elliptical Galaxy
PI:         Craig Sarazin

We propose 4 new Chandra observations of NGC4697, the nearest X-ray-faint,
optically-bright elliptical, which was resolved into low mass X-ray binaries
{LMXBs} in Cycle 1. We will detect LMXBs at least three times fainter {~1e37
ergs/s} than possible for any luminous E galaxy at present, allowing a direct
comparison with the LMXBs in our Galaxy and M31. We will measure the
variability of sources on times up to 4.5 yr. Models predict variability for
LMXBs in early-type galaxies, which is particularly strong for the brightest
black hole sources. We also propose 1 orbit of HST to detect >1500 globular
clusters {GCs}. If the results for luminous LMXBs continue to low LX, most of
the LMXBs will be identified with GCs. We will study the formation history of
LMXBs, GCs, and field stars in N4697.

Title:	    The Physics of Relativistic Jets: Chandra Imaging of Extended Jets
	    in Gamma-loud Blazars
PI:         F. Tavecchio

Extended jets have been a key target for Chandra yet only recently has the
kpc-scale jet physics been compared to that of the inner, parsec-scale jets.
Such a comparison reveals the jet deceleration, power dissipation, pressure
gradient, and confinement mechanism --- all essential ingredients for
understanding the relativistic jets that characterize radio- loud AGN.
Currently, few data exist to make this comparison. We propose to double the
sample, with Chandra observations of 4 gamma-loud blazars: 0954+556 and
1229-021, the only 2 bright radio jets not yet observed by Chandra; and
0208-512 and 3C 454.3, observed in A03 with much too short exposures. We also
propose HST multi-band ACS imaging of jet knots in 0208-512, 0954+556 and 3C
454.3.

Title:	    A Uniform Study of Globular Cluster X-raySources: The Keys to
	    Cluster Dynamical Evolution
PI:         Walter Lewin

We propose to extend our ongoing studies of the dynamical evolution of
globular clusters by observing their populations of low-luminosity X-ray
sources. Many of these sources are binary systems {or have evolved from them}
and hold the key to the clusters with widely different physical properties
such as central concentration, cluster size and mass, which are all key
ingredients in the formation and evolution of binaries. To make this study as
uniform as possible, the clusters will be observed to the same limiting
luminosity. Numberical simulations with the world's fastest computer will
assist in the interpretation of our observational data.
