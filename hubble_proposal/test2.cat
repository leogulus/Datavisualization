Title:	    Locating Ultraluminous X-Ray Sources
PI:         Philip Kaaret

We propose to observe ultraluminous X-ray sources which are located near
objects bright both in the X-rays and the optical using Chandra and HST. The
presence of these reference objects will allow us to tie the x-ray and optical
references frames and achieve 0.1-0.2 arcsecond relative position accuracy in
searching for optical counterparts to the ultraluminous x-ray sources. This
will be a significant improvement over the accuracy previously obtained for
most ULXs {limited by Chandra's absolute astrometry} and will should permit
identification of individual counterparts.

PI:         Eric Perlman

We propose deep followup HST and Chandra observations of two X-ray jets, which
are the X-ray brightest discovered in our Chandra survey of quasars with known
radio jets. With these data, we will compare their X-ray, optical and radio
morphologies. We will also obtain X-ray and optical spectral indices, and
spatially resolved SEDs from the radio through the X-rays. This will allow us
to determine the X-ray emission mechanism at each point in these jets, and
test critical predictions made by each mechanism. We will also be able to
track any changes in physical conditions {including magnetic field and bulk
Lorentz factor} that are present in the observed 90 degree bends.

PI:         Craig Sarazin

We propose 4 new Chandra observations of NGC4697, the nearest X-ray-faint,
optically-bright elliptical, which was resolved into low mass X-ray binaries
{LMXBs} in Cycle 1. We will detect LMXBs at least three times fainter {~1e37
ergs/s} than possible for any luminous E galaxy at present, allowing a direct
comparison with the LMXBs in our Galaxy and M31. We will measure the
variability of sources on times up to 4.5 yr. Models predict variability for
LMXBs in early-type galaxies, which is particularly strong for the brightest
black hole sources. We also propose 1 orbit of HST to detect >1500 globular
clusters {GCs}. If the results for luminous LMXBs continue to low LX, most of
the LMXBs will be identified with GCs. We will study the formation history of
LMXBs, GCs, and field stars in N4697.

Title:	    The Physics of Relativistic Jets: Chandra Imaging of Extended Jets
	    in Gamma-loud Blazars
PI:         F. Tavecchio

Extended jets have been a key target for Chandra yet only recently has the
kpc-scale jet physics been compared to that of the inner, parsec-scale jets.
Such a comparison reveals the jet deceleration, power dissipation, pressure
gradient, and confinement mechanism --- all essential ingredients for
understanding the relativistic jets that characterize radio- loud AGN.
Currently, few data exist to make this comparison. We propose to double the
sample, with Chandra observations of 4 gamma-loud blazars: 0954+556 and
1229-021, the only 2 bright radio jets not yet observed by Chandra; and
0208-512 and 3C 454.3, observed in A03 with much too short exposures. We also
propose HST multi-band ACS imaging of jet knots in 0208-512, 0954+556 and 3C
454.3.

PI:         Walter Lewin

We propose to extend our ongoing studies of the dynamical evolution of
globular clusters by observing their populations of low-luminosity X-ray
sources. Many of these sources are binary systems {or have evolved from them}
and hold the key to the clusters with widely different physical properties
such as central concentration, cluster size and mass, which are all key
ingredients in the formation and evolution of binaries. To make this study as
uniform as possible, the clusters will be observed to the same limiting
luminosity. Numberical simulations with the world's fastest computer will
assist in the interpretation of our observational data.

PI:         Michael Garcia

During A01-3 we found 22 Black Hole X-ray Novae {BHXN} in M31 using Chandra,
and with HST {WFPC2} found two optical counterparts. Our results suggest
either a surprisingly high ratio of BH to NS binaries, or a surprisingly high
duty cycle for BHXN. We propose to continue this program, with the goals of
understanding the relative number of BH vs. NS X-ray binaries in the M31
bulge, and determining the orbital period distribution and duty cycles of
these BHXN. Continued observations can determine the duty cycle. The new ACS
will allow us to go 2 mags deeper than the WFPC2, and could triple the number
of optical counterparts and therefore orbital period estimates. M31 is the
only galaxy near enough to allow this extragalactic survey for BHXN.

We propose to obtain the first high-quality, wide-band spectral energy
distribution {SED} of the neutron star X-ray nova Cen X-4 in quiescence. We
will compare this SED to those we have previously obtained for black hole
X-ray novae {BHXRN} in quiescence. Our previous comparisons of SEDs have been
very powerful in revealing the nature of these exotic objects; for example,
they have revealed the best evidence yet for the existence of event horizons.
These wide-band, high quality SEDs have revealed the presence of ADAFs in
BHXN, and are revealing the presence of winds {ADIOS} and/or convection
{CDAFs} in these flows. Previous SEDs of Cen X-4 have suffered from
non-simultaneity and have not included the FUV, where the emission may well
peak.

excellent photometry on the recently identified optical counterpart of
1E1339.8+2837 in the F220W, F250W and F330W bands. Using the ACS/WFC, we will
survey M3's central regions in B, V, and I to identify counterparts to other
Chandra sources, and also obtain excellent B, V, and I photometry of the

be derived. Nine HST orbits are requested to do the optical identifications in
this field down to Mv ~ 9, sufficient to identify most CVs and qLMXBs. This

Title:	    Long Term Monitoring of FGS1r in Position Mode
PI:         Edmund Nelan

It is known from our experience with FGS3, and later with FGS1r, that an FGS
on orbit experiences long term evolution, presumably due to disorption of
water from the instrument's graphite epoxy composits. This manifests principly
as a change in the plate scale and secondarily as a change in the geometric
distortions. These effects are well modeled by adjustments to the rhoA and kA
parameters which are used to transform the star selector servo angles into FGS
{x, y} detector space coordinates. By observing the relative positions of
selected stars in a standard cluster at a fixed telescope pointing and
orientation, the evolution of rhoA and kA can be monitored and calibrated to
preserve the astrometric performance of FGS1r.

Transfer Functions are needed to support the analysis of GO science data for

have been observed in previous cycles to monitor the long term evolution of
the FGS1r S-curves. This proposal also {1} monitors the FGS1r Lateral Color
response {using stars Latcol-A and Latcol-B}, {2} calibrates the "Pos/Trans"
bias of a star's position as determined from Transfer mode and Position mode
observations, and {3} calibrates the shift of a star's centroid when observed
with F5ND relative to that when observed with F583W.

Title:	    Spectrophotometry of FAINT IR STANDARDS
PI:         Ralph Bohlin

Faint spectrophotometric standard stars required for COS and the SBC channel
on ACS have been established via the STIS FASTEX program that has executed
over the last three cycles. Cycle 12 is an especially opportune time to
establish companion faint IR standards for WFC3, because the NICMOS proposal
9998 includes observations in cycle 12 of all 6 of the primary standard stars
in order to establish the absolute flux calibration of the three grism modes
to 1%. In addition to WFC3, these new faint secondary IR standards will be a
significant step towards establishing flux standards for JWST, as well as for
SNAP, SIRTF, and SOFIA. The 6 primary standards included in Propid=9998 are in
the range of V=11-13 and include three hot pure hydrogen WDs and 3 solar
analogs. We propose to establish new IR faint standards in the 15-17 mag
range. Appropriate spectral types for faint IR standards are solar analogs and
hotter WDs. Many M type and cooler stars are variable, so that long term
monitoring is required before committing HST time to such cool stars. A few G
type and WD faint stars will provide a set of faint IR standards with minimal
sky and color coverage. Existing HST images of any candidates can provide
verification that there are no contaminating stars above the 1% level within
2-3arcsec. However, the ACS calibration field in 47 Tuc is too crowded for
linking to ground based observations. If the other candidates are selected
from SDSS or other ground based data, then the NICMOS and STIS acquisition
images can provide this verification, as well as correction factors for
arbitrary photometric size apertures. The SNAP team is providing the northern
faint stars using unreleased SDSS data. In addition, the extreme coolest types
such as L and T stars have proven essential to sorting out the long wavelength
QE of ACS; both the ACS and eventually WFC3 calibrations could be improved
with knowledge of L and T SEDs in the region beyond 0.95 microns. In addition
to the primary purpose of ACS QE vs. wavelength and broad band F814W and
F850LP calibrations, these three stars in C.} below are at the flux level
required for WFC3 grism calibration. The brighter M, L, and T standard stars
will each require a NICMOS orbit, while each faint standard requires two
Nicmos orbits and one STIS orbit for complete wavelength coverage. The STIS
spectra of the M and L stars are done as ACS calibrations in cycles 12 and 11,
respectively. An additional faint WD has already been proposed for 2 Nicmos
and 4 STIS orbits in their cycle 12 programs already. See Table 1 for a
summary of the 18 orbit allocation for this program 10014. Bright stars in the
V=0-6 mag range would be useful for direct comparisons to NIST calibrated
lamps. This comparison would offer the opportunity to compare two
fundamentally different realms of physics: pure hydrogen stellar models and
laboratory black body physics. Unfortunately, the Nicmos bright limit is V=~8
for a solar analog and a 1s exposure without defocussing the OTA. The primary
Sloan standard BD+17d4708 at V=9.9 is safely fainter than this Nicmos limit.

The remaining time in the orbit will be spent extending the wavelength
coverage using G750L. To date, HST has not provided any faint solar analog
stars to compliment the three V=12-13.5 mag solar analogs provided by M. Rieke
for NICMOS calibration. As instrumentation in space and on the ground becomes
more sensitive, fainter flux standards are required. A solar analog in a field
with low reddening is an excellent choice for a fainter standard, because
unreddened pure hydrogen WDs are rare beyond V=16, because Solar absolute
fluxes are well measured at all wavelengths, and because the fluxes do not
fall off as fast as the hot WDs at longer wavelengths. A 16.5 G star may not
be faint enough for most JWST modes but will provide a significant step in the
right direction. The SNAP program requires such a spectrophotometric standard,
which lies at the bright limit of its spectroscopy mode. NICMOS grism
observation of this standard are planned for cycle 12 and STIS spectra are
required to establish the standard over the full range from 0.3-2 microns.

PI:         Bahram Mobasher

This is a follow-up study to proposal 8839 to study STIS CTE calibration for
extended objects. This takes images of galaxies to measure the effects of CTE
on the isophotes of galaxies. The aim is to image small {2-3"} extended
sources in a suitably rich galaxy cluster. The target, A1689, has been
observed by WFPC2 in the WF2 and WF4 chips {in Feb 2000}, so that
cross-instrument comparison will be straightforward. One orbit is needed per

first-order spectra in all L-modes {G191B2B only in the CCD modes due to its

the recently derived CTE formula for STIS Spectroscopic modes with the CCD, by
stepping the target along the slit {7 positions} with two {short} exposure
times. This will verify the results using the two-amplifier readout method,
and provide high-S/N data at low intensity levels and low background level.

Our recent discovery of a planetary-sized body in the inner Oort cloud

determine the size of this object, definitely determine if satellites exist,
and search for the shortest timescale photometric variations. As little is

The charge transfer efficiency {CTE} of the ACS CCD detectors will decline as

be closely monitored at regular intervals, because it is likely to determine
the useful lifetime of the CCDs. All the data for this program is acquired

emulates the ACS pre-flight ground calibration and post-launch SMOV testing

which accurate spectra have been {and will continue to be} measured with STIS.
Two SBC dark current exposures taken as the last exposure of each SBC
sequence. Also, to minimize SBS turn-on/turn-off cycles and in order to check
the lab flats for the SBC detector, internal observations using the deuterium
lamp with F125LP are being taken inflight, following the UV monitor
observations. The internal flats have been taken ~monthly since SMOV, and the
degradation of the lamp has been monitored. The total exposure time to date is
~15 hours giving a total of 8600 counts/pixel. The goal is 10, 000
counts/pixel such that the resulting pipeline flat has uncertainties of ~1%
due to poisson counting statistics. Thus, approximately 3 additional hours of

dithered observations of the cluster. In Cycle 11, this field was observed
again using single pointings at various roll angles. The positions and

as a result of bright object violations which trigger the Bright Scene
Detection or Software Global Monitors. Anomalous shutdowns can also occur as a
result of MAMA hardware problems. The Initial MAMA turn-on/recovery from
anomalous shutdown consists of three tests: a signal processing electronics
check, high voltage ramp-up to an intermediate voltage, and high voltage
ramp-up to the full operating voltage. During each of the two high voltage
ramp-ups, diagnostics are performed during a dark ACCUM. The turn-on is
followed by a MAMA Fold Analysis . The complete sequence is contained in
visits 1 through 4. If a second execution is required during cycle 12, visits

wavelengths {lambda_c} for {a} WFC {inner+outer} Halpha {FR716N, FR782N} and
[OIII] {FR551N, FR601N} ramp filters. {b} WFC middle ramp filters {FR388N,
FR459M, FR505N, FR6546N, FR914M}.{c} HRC middle ramp filters {FR388N, FR459M,
FR505N, FR656N, FR914M}. As a secondary goal, we will get an independent check
of the wavelength calibration which will be provided by the IDT team from the
Cycle 11 program 9671. We request 1.5 CVZ orbits to observe two
well-calibrated standard star fields in 47 Tuc with the primary goal of
deriving WFC and HRC continuum L-flats for three middle {WFC1-MRAMP} filters:
FR656N, FR388N, and FR505N. These filters are selected as they are frequently
used to map the Halpha 6563 A, [OII] 3727A, and [OIII] 5007A lines and they
include the least {FR388N} and most {FR505N} uniform ramps, based on ground
data {ISR ACS 02-01}. These 3 filters should provide a good baseline for
testing our approach and gauging the range of non-uniformity in the continuum
L-flats. For good spatial sampling, the 2 fields are selected with stellar
densities appropriate to WFC and HRC. For good spectral sampling we will step
in the central wavelength in steps of 80 A, with 30s exposure at each lambda_c
providing good S/N for V=15-20 mag stars. We will use 2K subarrays to reduce
the frequency of buffer dumps.

ACS G800L observations of an emission line star {the WC Wolf-Rayet star WR96}

improved coverage of the field variation of the dispersion solution for the

taken at many different positions across the WFC field. By fitting the
emission lines, the field dependence of the wavelength zero point and
dispersion will be measured. The WR star was already used in Cycle 11
calibrations and these observations provide improved spatial coverage to map
the variation of the dispersion with position. The observations of the fainter
planetary nebula provide an independent wavelength calibration for a few
points over the field.

PI:         Anton Koekemoer

This proposal is aimed at providing photometric zeropoint cross-calibration
between the commonly used WFPC2 photometric filter sets and those that will be
used for ACS and WFC3. The proposal consists of observations of a set of
standard stars, including the SDSS primary standard BD+17D4708 {F5} and two
red standard stars, VB8 {an M7-dwarf} and 2M0036+18 {L3.5 dwarf}. For the red
stars, medium and broad-band filters redward of F606W are calibrated, while
for BD+17D4708 an extensive set of 22 medium and broad-band filters is used
{from F185W to F1042M}. The intent is to observe these stars with as many
filters as possible, to eventually allow cross-calibration of archival WFPC2
data with data from ACS, WFC3, SDSS and 2MASS.

Title:	    Geometric distortion of F255W for WFPC2 Cycle 12
PI:         Vera Kozhurina-Platais

The goal of astrometric calibration of the HST WFPC2 is to obtain a coordinate
system free of distortion down to the precision level of 1 mas. That precision
is necessary for future astrometric work {e.g., on proper motions} involving a
combination of the archival WFPC2 and recent ACS images. So far such a
calibration has only been obtained for the wide bandpass F555W filter
{Anderson and King, 2003}. Recently V. Kozhurina-Platais {ISR, 2003-002} has
expanded the analysis of the geometric distortion of WFPC2 as a function of
wavelength for two other broadband filters, {F814W and F300W}, and has also
established the plate scale and skew parameters {non-perpendicularity of X and
Y axes} for these filters. This study points to the importance of astrometric
calibration at wavelengths shorter than ~400 nanometers. This proposal seeks
observations in the FUV filter F255W of the Inner Calibration Field in the
globular cluster omega Cen. It is expected that the amount of distortion in
the F255W filter with respect to the F555W filter will be higher by 5% but
this must be established from observations. A total of four astrometric
calibrations in F255W {proposed here}, and F300W, F555, F814W {already
completed} will allow us to interpolate such a calibration for any other
filter from FUV to near infrared.

Title:	    Is the exoplanet HD209458b's exosphere in a blowoff state ?
PI:         Alfred Vidal-Madjar

Using HST Lyman alpha observations, we have detected an extended tail shaped
upper atmosphere around the extra-solar planet HD209458b. The Cycle 10 STIS
G140M observations revealed an absorption of 15+/-4% of the stellar Lyman
alpha emission line during the planetary transit in front of the star
{Vidal-Madjar, et al. 2003}. This showed that HI evaporation is taking place
within a highly extended upper atmosphere. Very recent studies on the
evaporation mechanism are now indicating that instead of ``Jeans escape'' a
more probable mechanism is complete atmospheric ``blowoff'' as suffered by the
telluric planets in the early solar system. This mecanism could be directly
tested with HST by searching for the escape of species slightly heavier than
HI. It is easy to show that neither oxygen nor carbon would be detected with
HST if only ``Jeans escape'' takes place while both species, under ``blowoff''
conditions, should reach the Roche limit of the planet and escape as hydrogen.
If this is the case an absorption during transit of about 15% should be
observed for both. Twelve orbits with the STIS G140L spectrograph will allow
us to detect the presence of these species during three transits with a better
than 5% accuracy, needed to detect an object of the size of the planetary
Roche lobe. Simultaneously these observations will confirm and give more
precision about the extention of the HI cometary like tail expected to occult
the star well after the end of the visible transit. This proposed
investigation is a unique opportunity to further study hot giant planets upper
atmospheres, reveal the precise evaporation mechanism and give new constraints
on the ``hot Jupiters'' lifetime. This could explain the lack of planets
discovered so far at less than 0.04~AU from their star. We ask for HST
observations under Director Discretionnary time to have access to the coming
transits observable in the early fall of 2003.

Title:	    HST UV Images of Saturn's Aurora Coordinated with Cassini Solar
	    Wind Measurements
PI:         John Clarke

A key measurement goal of the Cassini mission to Saturn is to obtain
simultaneous solar wind and auroral imaging measurements in a campaign
scheduled for Jan. 2004. Cassini will measure the solar wind approaching
Saturn continuously from 9 Jan. - 6 Feb., but not closer to Saturn due to
competing spacecraft orientation constraints. The only system capable of
imaging Saturn's aurora in early 2004 will be HST. In this community DD
proposal we request the minimum HST time needed to support the Cassini mission
during the solar wind campaign with UV images of Saturn's aurora. Saturn's
magnetosphere is intermediate between the "closed" Jovian case with large
internal sources of plasma and the Earth's magnetosphere which is open to
solar wind interactions. Saturn's aurora has been shown to exhibit large
temporal variations in brightness and morphology from Voyager and HST
observations. Changes of auroral emitted power exceeding one order of
magnitude, dawn brightenings, and latitudinal motions of the main oval have
all been observed. Lacking knowledge of solar wind conditions near Saturn, it
has not been possible to determine its role in Saturn's auroral processes, nor
the mechanisms controlling the auroral precipitation. During Cassini's
upcoming approach to Saturn there will be a unique opportunity to answer these
questions. We propose to image one complete rotation of Saturn to determine
the corotational and longitudinal dependences of the auroral activity. We will
then image the active sector of Saturn once every two days for a total
coverage of 26 days during the Cassini campaign to measure the upstream solar
wind parameters. This is the minimum coverage needed to ensure observations of
the aurora under solar wind pressure variations of more than a factor of two,
based on the solar wind pressure variations measured by Voyager 2 near Saturn
on the declining phase of solar activity. The team of proposers has carried
out a similar coordinated observing campaign of Jupiter during the Cassini
flyby, resulting in a set of papers and HST images on the cover of Nature on
28 February 2002.

The ACS Ultra Deep Field {UDF} is a survey carried out by using Director's
Discretionary time. The main science driver are galaxy evolution and
cosmology. The primary instrument is the Advanced Camera for Surveys but WFPC2
and NICMOS will also be used in parallel. The data will be made public. The
UDF consists of a single ultra-deep field {410 orbits in total} within the
CDF-S GOODS area. The survey will use four filters: F435W {55 orbits}, F606W
{55 orbits}, F775W {150 orbits}, and F850LP {150 orbits}. The F435W {B} and
F606W {V} exposures will be one magnitude deeper than the equivalent HDF
filters. The F775W {I} exposure will be 1.5 magnitude deeper than the
equivalent HDF exposure. The depth in F775W and F850LP is optimized for
searching very red objects - like z=6 galaxies - at the detection limit of the
F850LP image. The pointing will be RA{J2000}=3 32 40.0 and Decl.{J2000}=-27 48
00. These coordinates may change slightly due to guide star availability and
implementation issues. We will attempt to include in the field both a
spectroscopically confirmed z=5.8 galaxy and a spectroscopically confirmed
type Ia SN at z=1.3. The pointing avoids the gaps with the lowest effective
exposure on the Chandra ACIS image of CDFS. This basic structure of the survey
represents a consensus recommendation of a Scientific Advisory Committee to
the STScI Director Steven Beckwith. A local Working Group is looking in detail
at the implementation of the survey.

We propose a 300~ks HETGS observation simultaneous with a 4--orbit HST {UV}
observation to study the archetypal infrared quasar IRAS13349+2438. We will
explore its enigmatic properties and search for signatures of embedded dust
{implicated by the high extinction} in the warm absorber clouds of this
object. We will plan to propose for simultaneous optical observations to be
taken using the 6.5-m Magellan telescope {through the PI host institution}.
The X-ray spectra will give unprecedented high- resolution information for
this source necessary for probing in detail the physical properties, chemical
compositions and velocities of the material surrounding the AGN. We will
additionally assess the `unresolved transition array' {UTA} reported for this
object, and search for and measure the neutral Fe L edge seen in a similarly
reddened AGN. This will be complemented with simultaneous HST UV spectra to
determine the continuum shape and to assess whether the UV/X-ray absorbers in
this system are related. The Chandra data will also allow us to look for
narrow features at >2 keV. Such a broad waveband study of this object will
enable us to obtain a complete picture of the geometry and physics of the
system, as well as the physical processes which are responsible for the
variability in the absorber.

Chandra Observations of Mira AB symbiotic-like system obtained in Dec. 2003
detected an unexpected bright soft source {<0.7 keV} in addition to the
previously observed harder {1-4 keV} emission which has been attributed to the
accretion disk around Mira B. The newly discovered soft X-ray source could
indicate an instability in the accretion disk, an accretion related outburst
in the system, or a flare-like activity in Mira A. We request DD time to carry
out HST/STIS imaging and spectroscopy of Mira AB at UV wavelengths, where
signatures of these processes are very likely to be found. Because of the
likely transient nature of this phenomenon, timely HST observations are
critical for determining the nature and the characteristics of the soft X-ray
source and therefore we cannot wait for Cucle 13 observatios including TOO

We will undertake a 2 square degree imaging survey {Cosmic Evolution Survey --

wide field survey is essential to understand the interplay between Large Scale
Structure {LSS} evolution and the formation of galaxies, dark matter and AGNs
and is the one region of parameter space completely unexplored at present by
HST. The equatorial field was selected for its accessibility to all
ground-based telescopes and low IR background and because it will eventually
contain ~100, 000 galaxy spectra from the VLT-VIMOS instrument. The imaging
will detect over 2 million objects with I> 27 mag {AB, 10 sigma}, over 35, 000
Lyman Break Galaxies {LBGs} and extremely red galaxies out to z ~ 5. COSMOS is
the only HST project specifically designed to probe the formation and
evolution of structures ranging from galaxies up to Coma-size clusters in the
epoch of peak galaxy, AGN, star and cluster formation {z ~0.5 to 3}. The size
of the largest structures necessitate the 2 degree field. Our team is
committed to the assembly of several public ancillary datasets including the
optical spectra, deep XMM and VLA imaging, ground-based optical/IR imaging, UV
imaging from GALEX and IR data from SIRTF. Combining the full-spectrum
multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic coverage with ACS sub-kpc

Title:	    Mid-Ultraviolet Spectral Templates for Old Stellar Systems
PI:         Ruth Peterson

We propose a three-year program to provide both observational and theoretical
mid-ultraviolet {2300A -- 3100A} spectral templates for interpreting the age
and metallicity of globular clusters and elliptical galaxies from spectra of
their integrated light. The mid-UV is the region most directly influenced by
stellar age, and is observed directly in optical and infrared studies of
high-redshift quiescent systems. The reliability of age and metallicity
determinations remains questionable until non-solar metallicities and
abundance ratios are considered, and stars spanning the color-magnitude
diagram are included, as we propose here. With archival HST STIS spectra we
have improved the list of mid-UV atomic line parameters, then calculated
spectra from first principles which match observed spectra of standard stars
up to one- fourth solar metallicity. We will extend both observations and
calculations to stars of solar metallicity and beyond, and to those in
short-lived stages hotter than the main-sequence turnoff, stars not currently
well-represented in empirical libraries. The necessary line-list improvements
will come from new high-resolution mid-UV spectra of nine field stars. A key
application of the results of this program will be to the old systems now
being discovered as `Extremely Red Objects' at high redshifts. Reliable
age-dating of these places constraints on the epoch when large structures
first formed in the universe.

PI:         Pilar Ruiz-Lapuente

Type Ia supernovae are of key importance in cosmology. Empirical relations
allow their use as cosmological standard candles. The generally accepted
picture is that the exploding star is a C+O white dwarf which accretes matter
from a companion in a binary system. However, the nature of the companion is
still unknown. It could either be another WD, or be a giant, subgiant, or
main-sequence star. Calculations have shown that it is possible to distinguish
among those possibilities by the effect that the supernova explosion has on
the companion star. We propose to identify the companion star of the two
historical well-known SNeIa through ACS imaging of the targets complemented by
WFPC2 observations. A radial-velocity study of the stars in those two Galactic
SNeIa has been done from ground-based facilities. To obtain the full motion
vector of those stars, we plan to use ACS for high-resolution astrometry in
two different epochs. That should allow to detect motion imparted during the
explosion in the d ir ection perpendicular to the line of sight, down to a
level of a few milliarcsecs/yr.

The distances to neutron stars are a fundamental parameter that impacts
estimates of radii and luminosities, both of which have important
ramifications for neutron star heating and cooling and for the equation of
state of nuclear matter. A radius measured to 5% accuracy will provide useful
astrophysical constraints on the equation of matter at nuclear densities. This
requires an accurate measurment of the distance. Caraveo et al. have reported
a distance to the isolated pulsar Geminga based on three WFPC2 images. We have
not been able to reproduce that result. We request time with the ACS/WFC over
two years to obtain 4 images in order to determine the parallax of Geminga. In
addition to the general importance of understanding neutron star radii and
luminosities, this will provide specific insights into the history of gamma
ray pulsars in general, and of Geminga itself. We have obtained the first two

Title:	    Tracking the Evolution of a Knotty, High- Speed Jet in the Carbon

PI:         Raghvendra Sahai

The carbon star V Hydrae is experiencing heavy mass loss as it undergoes the
transition from AGB star to pre-planetary nebula. This is possibly the
earliest object known in this brief phase. Molecular observations reveal that
a bipolar nebula has been established even at this early stage. Using STIS on
the HST, we have discovered a high-velocity {> 200 km/s} jet or blob of gas
which was ejected only ~2 years ago from near the star. A second STIS
observation 11 months later clearly showed both its proper motion and the fact
that it is being strongly decelerated. We propose STIS monitoring of this
remarkable event for an additional 3 years, in order to: 1} obtain a precise
dynamical and cooling history of this blob, and 2} determine whether the
ejection of such blobs is associated with, or perhaps phased with, the 530-day
stellar period. This ejection event is likely to hold the key to understanding
why initially spherical mass outflows adopt a bipolar geometry during the
post-AGB phase of stellar evolution. We not only have the opportunity to look
on as the circumstellar envelope is sculpted by this and perhaps other
collimated mass ejections, but we also have an unprecedented chance to
constrain the mechanism for mass ejection, and thereby help solve a
long-standing puzzle. Finally, molecular line observations and our previous
STIS H$lpha$ observations show that the V Hya system contains a prominent,
central disk. We propose a follow-up study in H$lpha$ in order to better
define the disk properties, and thereby to determine whether the disk plays a
role in the collimation of the emerging blob. We will use the data to
constrain hydrodynamical models of collimated jet interactions with the
ambient circumstellar medium in V Hydrae, in order to set quantitative
constraints on the physical properties of the blobby outflow.

PI:         Mark Showalter

Last year, our Uranian ring and moon observing program {GO-9823} resulted in
the discovery of two moons, S/2003 U 1 and S/2003 U 2. We imaged two
additional small moons, Ophelia and S/1986 U 10, that had not been seen since
the Voyager encounter of 1986. Furthermore, our data show faint arcs and
clumps orbiting within the rings, which were not seen by Voyager and are
completely unexpected. We employed several "tricks" of the HRC to achieve this
remarkable senstivity; specifically, we used the CLEAR filter and oriented the
images so that the planet, though vastly overexposed, did not interfere with
the ring/moon region of interest to us. This allowed us to detect
25th-magnitude moons circling a 5th-magnitude planet. Now we propose to
complete the task by carrying out a comprehensive survey of the system using
the same techniques. Our goals are to recover the moons, better discern their
orbital elements, and learn more about the dynamics of the ring clumps. In
particular, we need to {1} understand the long-term stability of S/2003 U 2,
which orbits perilously close to the larger moon Belinda; {2} complete our
search for moons, which was only ~ 50% complete last year, and {3} better
understand how the clumps and arcs within the ring system might relate to
nearby "shepherding" moons, seen or unseen. This program is now a merger of

latter is the second year of our three-year program to study the light
scattering properties of Uranus's rings as they approach their edge-on

intermediate data products, would produce the observed radial velocity
amplitude, K = 66 ms with a companion mass of ~8 M_Jupiter. Such a mass would
induce in Upsilon Andromedae a perturbation semi-major axis, Alpha =
0arcs0012, easily within the reach of HST/FGS fringe tracking astrometry. The
proposed observations will yield a planetary mass, rather than, as previous
investigations have done, only suggest a planetary mass companion.

Title:	    Calibrating the Mass-Luminosity Relation at the End of the Main
	    Sequence
PI:         Todd Henry

We propose to use HST-FGS1R to calibrate the mass-luminosity relation {MLR}
for stars less massive than 0.2 Msun, with special emphasis on objects near
the stellar/brown dwarf border. Our goals are to determine M_V values to 0.05
magnitude, masses to 5 than double the number of objects with masses
determined to be less than 0.20 Msun. This program uses the combination of
HST-FGS3/FGS1R at optical wavelengths and ground-based infrared interferometry
to examine nearby, subarcsecond binary systems. The high precision
measurements with HST-FGS3/FGS1R {to 1 mas in the separations} for these faint
targets {V = 10--15} simply cannot be equaled by any ground based technique.
As a result of these measurements, we are deriving high quality luminosities
and masses for the components in the observed systems, and characterizing
their spectral energy distributions from 0.5 to 2.2 Mum. Several of the
objects included have M < 0.1 Msun, placing them at the very end of the
stellar main sequence. Three of the targets are brown dwarf candidates,
including the current low mass record holder, GJ 1245C, with a mass of 0.062
+/- 0.004 Msun. The payoff of this proposal is high because all 10 of the
systems selected have already been resolved with HST- FGS3/FGS1R during Cycles
5--10 and contain most of the reddest objects for which masses can be
determined.

Title:	    Accurate Mass Determination of the Ancient White Dwarf   ER 8
	    Through Astrometric Microlensing
PI:         Kailash Sahu

We propose to determine the mass of the very cool white dwarf ER 8 through
astrometric microlensing. We have predicted that ER 8 will pass very close to
a 15th-mag background star in January 2006, with an impact parameter of less
than 0.05 arcsec. As it passes in front, it will cause a deflection of the
background star's image by >8 milliarcsec, an amount easily detectable with
HST/FGS. The gravitational deflection angle depends only on the distances and
relative positions of the stars, and on the mass of the white dwarf. Since the
distances and positions can be determined precisely before the event, the
astrometric measurement offers a unique and direct method to measure the mass
of the white dwarf to high accuracy {<5%}. Unlike all other stellar mass
determinations, this technique works for single stars {but only if they are
nearby and of sufficient mass}. The mass of ER 8 is of special interest
because it is a member of the Galactic halo, and appears to be the oldest
known field white dwarf. This object can thus set a lower limit on the age of
the Galactic halo, but since white-dwarf cooling rates depend on their masses,
the mass is a necessary ingredient in the age determination. As a byproduct,
we will obtain an accurate parallax for ER 8, and thus its luminosity and
{from its effective temperature} its radius. Such quantities are at present
rather poorly known for the coolest white dwarfs, and will provide strong
constraints on white-dwarf physics.

We propose to measure the parallaxes of 10 Galactic Cepheid variables. When
these parallaxes {with 1-sigma precisions of 10% or better} are added to our
recent HST FGS parallax determination of delta Cep {Benedict et al 2002}, we
anticipate determining the Period-Luminosity relation zero point with a 0.03
mag precision. In addition to permitting the test of assumptions that enter
into other Cepheid distance determination techniques, this calibration will
reintroduce Galactic Cepheids as a fundamental step in the extragalactic
distance scale ladder. A Period-Luminosity relation derived from solar
metallicity Cepheids can be applied directly to extragalactic solar
metallicity Cepheids, removing the need to bridge with the Large Magellanic
Cloud and its associated metallicity complications.

PI:         Douglas Gies

The O-type star 15 Mon {HD 47839} was recently discovered to be an astrometric
and spectroscopic binary with a period of 25 years; it is the first known
O-star system to bridge the observational gap between the period regimes
normally probed by these techniques. An analysis of both the radial velocity
curve and astrometric orbit yields the masses of the components and distance
to the system. Continuing radial velocity and HST/FGS astrometric measurements
will lead to a definitive orbit and yield key information about the masses of
O-type stars. FGS TRANS mode measurements of separation, position angle, and
magnitude difference {begun in Cycle 5} are needed to link existing speckle
observations and anticipated observations with the CHARA Array optical
interferometer. In addition, field astrometry measurements {FGS POS mode} will
provide the proper motion, parallax, and the binary motion around the center
of mass. The POS data will provide an accurate estimate of the mass ratio and
an improved estimate of distance, and taken together with the spectroscopic
and astrometric orbital data, we will obtain masses for both components
accurate to a few percent.

Title:	    Dynamical Masses and Radii of Four White Dwarf Stars
PI:         Edmund Nelan

The cool white dwarf stars WD1639+153 and WD1818+126 were recently resolved by
HST FGS1r to be double degenerate binary systems with projected separations of
112 mas and 174 mas respectively. At a distance of less than 50 pc they may
both have periods shorter than about 20 years, making them ideal candidates
for follow up studies for dynamical mass determinations. This will increase
the number of white dwarfs with dynamical mass measurements from the current 4
up to 8. Continued observations of these white dwarfs along with nearby field
stars with the FGS will accuractely determine the orbital elements and
parallax of each system. The mass and radius of all four white dwarfs can be
determined to an unprecedented 1%, making it possible to test and calibrate
the theoretical white dwarf mass radius relation at the cool end of the
cooling curve for the DA and DC subclasses. Since the components of the binary
are coeval, once the mass and radius, and hence the cooling age of each star
is known, it will be possible to estimate the relation between the initial
mass and final mass for all four white dwarfs. We are requesting a total of 4
HST orbits per year for the next three cycles to initiate the process that
will result in a determination of the mass and radius of the four white
dwarfs.

PI:         M. Sean O'Brien

PG 0122+200 is a pulsating hot white dwarf that is believed to radiate more
energy as neutrinos than it does as photons. We propose to measure with FGS
the trigonometric parallax of PG 0122+200 and thereby determine its distance,
luminosity, and mass. Ongoing investigations from the ground will infer the
neutrino luminosity through its effect on the pulsation periods, thus testing
standard and non-standard lepton theory, but the stellar mass must first be
known. The pulsation spectrum of PG 0122+200 admits two alternative
seismological interpretations, each implying a different mass, luminosity, and
distance. Measurement of an accurate distance will resolve the matter once and
for all and precisely determine the stellar mass. This project represents the
first test of lepton physics in dense {log rho = 6} plasma and is relevant to
the many areas of stellar physics in which neutrino interactions are
important, including recent theories intended to solve the solar-neutrino
problem.

Title:	    Parallaxes of Extreme Halo Subgiants: Calibrating Globular Cluster
	    Distances and the Ages of the Oldest Stars
PI:         Don Vandenberg

The ages of the oldest stars are a key constraint on the evolution of our
Galaxy, the history of star formation, and cosmological models. These ages are
usually determined from globular clusters. However, it is alternatively
possible to determine ages of extreme Population II subgiants in the solar
neighborhood based on trigonometric parallaxes, without any recourse to
clusters. This approach completely avoids the vexing issues of cluster
distances, reddenings, and chemical compositions. There are 3 known nearby,
extremely metal-deficient Pop II subgiants with Hipparcos parallax errors of
6-11% which are available for such age determinations. At present, based on
the latest isochrones, the derived ages of these stars {HD 84937, HD 132475,
and HD 140283} are all close to 14 Gyr, uncomfortably close to or higher than
current estimates of the age of the universe. However, the errors in the
Hipparcos parallaxes imply uncertainties of at least 2 Gyr in the ages of the
3 stars. We propose to measure parallaxes of these three Pop II subgiants
using HST's Fine Guidance Sensor 1R. We expect to reduce the Hipparcos
parallax error bars by factors of 5-6, providing the most stringent test yet
of current theoretical stellar models of Pop II stars and pushing the age
uncertainties to below 0.5 Gyr. These data will also provide a major new
constraint on the distance scale of globular clusters, with wide implications
for stellar evolution and the calibration of Pop II standard candles.

This is a continuation of a program carried out in Cycles 7--10. Sakurai's
Object {V4334 Sgr} presents a ``once-in-a-lifetime'' opportunity for real-time
observations of a star undergoing a final helium thermal pulse. The star rose
from obscurity to become an 11th-magnitude ``born-again'' hydrogen-deficient
red giant in 1995-96, and currently it is undergoing episodes of atmospheric
dust formation. If it follows the pattern that the similar object V605 Aql
took early in the 20th century, it will soon begin evolving back to high
temperature. During the subsequent few years, it will begin to {re}-ionize its
large, faint, old planetary nebula as well as the new ejecta, and we should be
able to witness the re-establishment and evolution of a fast stellar wind as
the effective temperature increases. When the star does begin to heat up, we
will initiate Target-of-Opportunity STIS observations to monitor the star's
spectroscopic development in the UV at regular intervals, continuing over the
next 3 Cycles. We will also use ACS/HRC twice over the next 3 years to
continue our monitoring of the expansion of the ejecta and to determine the
star's proper motion. In combination with ground-based monitoring {optical,
IR, and mm}, we will thus produce the first detailed case study of a thermal
pulse, as the star re-traces its evolution across the HR diagram from the AGB
back to the hot planetary-nebula-nucleus phase.

of three visual binary stars that will ultimately yield fundamental
astrophysical results, once their orbits and masses are determined. Our
targets are the following: {1} Procyon {P = 41 yr}, for which our first WFPC2
images yielded an extremely accurate angular separation of the bright F star
and its much fainter white-dwarf companion. Combined with ground-based
astrometry of the bright star, our observation significantly revised downward
the derived masses, and brought Procyon A into excellent agreement with
theoretical evolutionary tracks for the first time. With the continued
monitoring proposed here, we will obtain masses to an accuracy of better than
1%, providing a testbed for theories of both Sun-like stars and white dwarfs.
{2} G 107-70, a close double white dwarf {P = 19 yr} that promises to add two
accurate masses to the tiny handful of white-dwarf masses that are directly
known from dynamical measurements. {3} Mu Cas {P = 21 yr}, a famous
metal-deficient G dwarf for which accurate masses will lead to the stars'
helium contents, with cosmological implications.

Title:	    Trigonometric Calibration of the Period- Luminosity Relations for
	    Fundamental and First-Overtone Galactic Cepheids
PI:         Howard Bond

Cepheids are the primary distance indicators for the extragalactic distance
scale and the Hubble constant. The Hubble Constant Key Project set the
zero-point for their Cepheid distance scale by adopting a distance to the LMC,
averaged over a variety of techniques. However, different methods give an LMC
distance modulus ranging from 18.1 to 18.8, and the uncertainty in the Cepheid
zero-point is now the largest contributor to the error budget for H_0.
Moreover, the low metallicity of the LMC raises additional concerns, since the
PL relation probably depends on metallicity. The zero-point can be determined
from Hipparcos parallaxes of Galactic Cepheids out to several hundred parsecs,
but with a typical parallax error of 0.5-1 mas, the Hipparcos error bars are
uncomfortably large for this demanding application. By contrast, HST's FGS1R
interferometer can achieve astrometric accuracy of 0.2 mas. We propose to use
FGS1R to determine trigonometric parallaxes for a sample of 9 nearby Cepheids,
including both fundamental {F} and first-overtone {FO} pulsators. We show that
the improvement in the PL relations for F and FO Cepheids will be dramatic. We
will determine the PL slopes from our nearby solar- metallicity sample alone,
without recourse to nearby galaxies and the issue of [Fe/H] dependence. The
zero-point will be determined robustly to about 0.05 mag, based on accurate,
purely geometrical measurements. All of this can be achieved in the next few
years with HST, without having to wait for the technically demanding and risky
SIM and GAIA missions well into the next decade.

PI:         Edward Guinan

The chromospheric H I Ly_alpha 1215.6 feature is the dominant source of
short-wave emission in the Sun and solar-type stars, contributing about 80-90%
of the total FUV flux and 30-60% of the total flux between 1 and 1500 A. Also,
this important chromospheric line is the major cooling channel for cool star
atmospheres. Accurate Ly_alpha fluxes are the only missing element of our
ongoing "Sun in Time" program. This program studies a sample of single G0-5 V
stars with well-known physical properties that serve as proxies for the Sun
{and solar-mass stars} over their main sequence lifetimes. One of the major
goals of the program is the determination of the spectral irradiance of the
early Sun. Our analyses indicate that the strong XUV emissions of the young
Sun have played a crucial role in the developing planetary system. In
particular, the expected strong Ly_alpha line flux may have greatly influenced
the photoionization, photochemical evolution and possible erosion of planetary
atmospheres, as well as played a role in the origin and development of life on
Earth. The "Sun in Time" data can also be applied to investigate the
atmospheric loss of exoplanets around solar-type stars resulting from XUV
heating, which can eventually lead to the evaporation of "hot Jupiters". We
propose to use HST/STIS-MAMA/E140M to determine accurate FUV and Ly-alpha
fluxes and irradiances for 4 representative solar proxies with ages from 130
Myr to 6.7 Gyr. It is only with HST's high-resolution UV spectroscopy {to
correct for ISM absorption} and the small aperture {to eliminate geocoronal
emission} that the stellar Ly-alpha profile can be reliably modeled and its
flux measured. The proposed study is of capital importance in reconstructing
the evolutionary histories of exoplanets already known and additional planets
that missions such as COROT, Kepler, SIM, and Darwin/TPF will discover in the

Title:	    Towards an Accurate Calibration of the Galactic Cepheid P-L Zero
	    Point
PI:         Edward Guinan

The young open cluster NGC 7790 is unique and astrophysically important
because it contains three classical Cepheid variables {CF Cas, CE Cas A, and
CE Cas B}. If the distance of NGC 7790 were known with certainty, these
Cepheids would define the zero point for the galactic Cepheid
Period-Luminosity {P-L} relationship. By a stroke of good luck, NGC 7790 also
contains a 10th-mag eclipsing binary located near the turnoff of the
main-sequence of the color-magnitude diagram of the cluster. This important
eclipsing binary has been little studied until now and contains two B1IV-V+B3V
stars with an orbital period of P=6.005 days. With HST we propose to secure
the accurate distance and reddening of QX Cas {and thus of the Cepheids} by
using eclipsing binaries as precise standard candles, as we have demonstrated
in our work on the Large Magellanic Cloud. With absolute radii, temperatures,
and luminosities of the stars known from ground-based and HST observations,
the method is essentially geometric and free from many of the uncertainties
that plague other less direct methods. Light and radial velocity curve data
will be combined with the proposed HST/STIS spectrophotometry {1150-8000 A} to
determine the physical properties of the eclipsing binary and thus to secure
an accurate distance and reddening for NGC 7790. The determination of the
stars' temperatures, reddenings and chemical abundances, and therefore the
cluster's distance, with the necessary accuracy can only be accomplished with
HST. According to our previous experience, we expect a resulting distance
determination with an accuracy of about 2-3%. HST/STIS spectrophotometry will
be carried out also for the three Cepheids to determine their properties and
individual reddenings. Thus, the proposed HST observations could help
eliminate the current nagging uncertainty of the galactic Cepheid zero point
and provide the key for a firm calibration of the P-L relationship.

We will carry out a STIS/NUV-MAMA snapshot imaging survey of the most compact
powerful radio galaxies, the Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum {GPS} sources and
Compact Steep Spectrum {CSS} sources. These objects are as powerful as the
large radio doubles but are much smaller {and younger} and are crucial to our
understanding not only of how radio-loud active galactic nuclei {AGN} form and
evolve, but also what role they play in the evolution of galaxies. A very
direct and robust way to address these issues is by high resolution imaging of
the host galaxies of these sources in the UV. This has never been done before
for a sample of these very compact sources, since previous HST/UV imaging
programs have focussed on the larger radio galaxies. The UV emission can
provide crucial information about any recent star formation that may have
occurred as a result of ongoing accretion, mergers, interactions, or
triggering by the radio source. By comparing the starburst properties of GPS,
CSS, and large scale radio sources, we will be able to constrain the evolution
of massive star formation as a function of the relative age of the radio
source. {Note, due to the failure of STIS, these observations will be carried
out using the ACS/HRC}.

Title:	    Imaging the Chemical Distribution in Type Ia SN Ejecta
PI:         Robert Fesen

We know Type Ia supernovae are thermonuclear explosions of CO white dwarfs,
but we don't know the specifics of how the nuclear burning process proceeds
from the core outward once it starts. The thermonuclear instability is thought
to start off as a subsonic, turbulent deflagration or burning wave but then,
at some point, may transition into a blast or detonation wave. In such
"delayed detonation" models, differences between normal and subluminous Type
Ia SNe reflect differences in the amount of burning that has occurred in the
pre-detonation phase. More burning helps to pre-expand the WD before passage
of the detontation wave, which then results in different final element
abundances and internal Fe-rich ejecta structure. Directly imaging the 2-D
chemical distribution of ejecta from a Type Ia SN is actually possible in the
case of the subluminous Type Ia SN 1885, which occurred on the near-side of
M31's central bulge. This 119 year old remnant is visible -- from its core to
its outer edge -- via strong optical/UV Ca and Fe line absorptions.
Remarkably, the SNR appears to still be in a nearly free expansion phase,
meaning that the elemental stratification seen present today accurately
reflects SN Ia explosive nucleosynthesis physics. We propose to obtain ACS
WFC/HRC images of SN 1885 in order to take advantage of this extraordinary
situation: Having a young, nearby Type Ia SN remnant visible in silhouette
against a galaxy-size light table. These unique observations will reveal a SN
Ia's Ca and Fe ejecta distribution, density structure, sphericity, and
ionization state as a function of expansion velocity, thereby confronting
various SN Ia models with detailed ejecta stratification and expansion
velocity maps.

Seven years after the afterglow detections that revolutionized studies of the
long-soft gamma-ray bursts, not even one afterglow of a short-hard GRB has
been seen, and the nature of these events has become one of the most important
problems in GRB research. The forthcoming Swift satellite will report
few-arcsecond localizations for short-hard bursts in minutes, however,
enabling prompt, deep optical afterglow searches for the first time. Discovery
and observation of the first short-hard optical afterglows will answer most of
the critical questions about these events: What are their distances and
energies? Do they occur in distant galaxies, and if so, in which regions of
those galaxies? Are they the result of collimated or quasi-spherical
explosions? In combination with an extensive rapid-response ground-based
campaign, we propose to make the critical high-sensitivity HST TOO
observations that will allow us to answer these questions. If theorists are
correct in attributing the short-hard bursts to binary neutron star
coalescence events, then the short-hard bursts are signposts to the primary
targeted source population for ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, and
short-hard burst studies will have a vital role to play in guiding their

PI:         Scott Anderson

Close binaries are fundamental to the dynamical stability and evolution of
globular clusters, but large populations have been extremely difficult to
identify. Chandra X-ray images provide a revolutionary resource, revealing a
few to dozens of low-luminosity X-ray sources in every cluster deeply
examined; our own Chandra programs uniformly study these ubiquitous X-ray
sources {close binaries and their progeny} in 11 clusters. However, definitive
understanding of the nature of the various X-ray subpopulations requires the
identification of optical counterparts, and HST is the demonstrated key in
these crowded environments. We thus propose a proven, efficient, and uniform,
HST multicolor imaging program for optical identifications in 6 of our
clusters with Chandra data on-hand, but which lack adequate optical images in
the HST archive. The proposed ACS images will permit statistical
classifications into the various subtypes: CVs, qLMXBs, BY Dra's/RS CVn's {and
MSPs}. A unique aspect of our program is that our clusters span a range of
physical properties such as central concentration, cluster size, and
mass--essential ingredients in the formation, evolution, and dynamical roles
of cluster binaries. Exploiting this range of properties, we have identified a
relation that provides the first compelling link between the number of X-ray
sources and the predicted stellar encounter frequency in globular cluster
cores. But further progress in understanding the details implicit in this
relationship {e.g., whether CVs and qLMXBs formed primarily via stellar
encounters, while BY Dra's/RS CVn's are mainly primordial binaries} demands
uniform optical identifications for multiple clusters, spanning the full range
physical properties.

Recently, three variable stars have been identified as likely accreting binary

revealed periodicities of 5-10 minutes, making them the closest binaries known
as well as strong sources of gravitational wave emission. Such short-period
accreting binaries form the cornerstone to our understanding of binary
formation and evolution, in particular of the large double white dwarf
population in our galaxy, a candidate progenitor population for Type Ia
supernovae. We propose to obtain the first UV observations of these objects
using STIS in order to {i} determine the temperature of the primary and the
composition of their donor stars, {ii} correlate the UV variability with other
wavebands and determine if the periods are indeed orbital, {iii} look for
dynamical signatures of direct-impact accretion that is expected to govern the
survival rate of double white dwarfs. These UV observations are essential in
order to unequivocally determine whether these are indeed the most compact

Title:	    Microarcsecond Imaging of a Gravitationally Lensed QSO: 2237+0305
PI:         Rachel Webster

The microarcsecond scale structure of the central region of the
gravitationally lensed quasar, 2237+0305, can be determined from its
wavelength dependent lightcurve if viewed during a microlensing event. We are
monitoring the QSO from the ground at regular intervals to ascertain the onset
of a microlensing event. STIS spectra will then be taken and compared with the
spectra taken after the event. As the microlensing event occurs, we will
measure wavelength- dependent changes in the continuum, and also the
variations in lines with different ionizations. Thus we will use microlensing
to directly probe the structure of the source QSO on microarcsecond scales --
a factor of ten smaller than those measured by indirect techniques such as
reverberation mapping. An already approved CHANDRA Cycle 3 GO program will
provide complementary X-ray data, thus greatly increasing the wavelength range
over which we hope to probe the quasar's inner structure.

Title:	    Physical Processes in Orion's Veil:  A High Resolution UV
	    Absorption Study of the Line of Sight towards the Trapezium
PI:         Gary Ferland

Star formation is governed by a complex interplay among magnetic, thermal,
turbulent and gravitational energies. Of these, magnetic energies are the most
difficult to measure. Yet magnetic energies are crucial to the evolution of
molecular clouds if they are comparable to other energies. Unfortunately,
magnetic field strength measurements are sparse. Moreover, detailed field
strength maps exist in only one region of the ISM, the veil of neutral
material in front of the Orion Nebula. From the Zeeman effect in 21cm HI
absorption lines, we have accurate maps of the line-of-sight field strength in
two independent velocity components of the veil. Therefore, the veil presents
a unique laboratory for study of magnetic effects in star forming regions. We
have recently combined archival UV absorption line data with photoionization
models to estimate the veil's density, temperature and level of ionization. On
this basis, we infer that magnetic energies far exceed turbulent and thermal
energies in at least one HI velocity component. This component is magnetically
unique. All other data about star forming regions suggest equipartition
between magnetic and turbulent energies. Our analysis of physical conditions
in Orion's veil suffers from an important limitation. Existing UV absorption
line data have insufficient spectral resolution to separate the two HI
velocity components. Therefore, our models reflect average conditions in the
two components. Yet actual conditions are likely to be quite different since
one component must lie closer to the source of ionization. We propose to use
STIS to obtain high resolution UV spectra of Theta 1 Ori B. These data will
allow us to model the two velocity components separately. We can then estimate
magnetic and other energies in the two components. We will determine if the
apparent magnetic uniqueness of one component applies to both, and we will
estimate the distances of each component from the ionizing stars. This study
will provide the most comprehensive information obtainable about the role of
magnetic effects in a star forming region.

Title:	    Where is the Wind in 1H0707-495?
PI:         Karen Leighly

We propose three observations using HST STIS of the narrow-line Seyfert 1
galaxy 1H 0707-495 to be coordinated with already-approved deep exposures
using FUSE. A previous HST observation of 1H 0707-495 revealed strongly
blueshifted high-ionization lines, suggesting an origin in an outflowing wind.
Detailed photoionization modeling reveals that the wind line fluxes and ratios
are consistent with two solutions: a high-density, high-column solution,
originating close to the central engine, and a low-density, low-column
solution, located much further out. These two locations, interestingly,
correspond to those predicted by two different physical models for winds in
AGNs. We can differentiate between these models by observing emission line
variability on two time scales, and examining relative variability of OVI
obtained by FUSE and CIV and other lines obtained by HST. We will also look
for profile variability, constrain velocity ionization stratification through
a detailed study of the profiles, and investigate metallicity, which has been
suggested to be high in NLS1s. This program, requiring only a modest amount of
time, is expected to make significant contributions to our understanding of
outflows in AGN, and the structure, origin and metallicity of the broad-line
region.

We propose to exploit the exceptional spatial resolution of HST to
definitively show whether the SMC is tidally elongated along the
line-of-sight, and therefore the status of the Milky Way's
interaction/destruction of the Magellanic Clouds. We use BVI ACS images of
several crowded SMC fields in the region predicted by models of the orbit and
tidal evolution of the Magellanic Clouds {and by observations of Cepheids} to
have a large depth. We exploit the red clump feature {and the rarer true
horizontal branch} to derive the depth. Specifically, we will observe six
fields along the predicted region of maximum distance gradient of the SMC,
along with two ACS fields and several WFPC2 fields in the archives, to map out
the depth of the SMC in this region. We are searching for substructure, such
as a tidal tail, that may be present. Crowding in this region of the SMC is so
severe that this project cannot be done from the ground.

We propose imaging a rich protocluster, 0316-26 at z = 3.13, with 31 confirmed
Lya cluster members. The bright radio galaxy host is identified with the
progenitor of the dominant cluster galaxy. Because its redshift places Lya
into an ACS narrow-band filter, the protocluster provides a unique laboratory
for studying galaxies at a crucial epoch in the evolution of the Universe. We
shall {i} measure and compare sizes, morphologies and colors of galaxies from
populations detected using 4 different selection techniques {Lyman and 4000A
breaks, Lya and [OIII] excesses}, {ii} study effects of an overdense
environment by comparing the properties of protocluster galaxies with z~3
field galaxies from GOODS, {iii} study effects of evolution by relating our
data to observations of similar protocluster/cluster targets at redshifts z =

cluster galaxies by investigating the spatial distribution, Lya equivalent
widths and other properties within the 5" radio galaxy host. The ultimate aim
is to disentangle the history of structure development and stellar evolution
for rich clusters of galaxies.

PI:         Annette Ferguson

Over the past several years, our group has conducted a large panoramic
ground-based imaging survey of resolved luminous stars in M31 using the INT
Wide-Field Camera. Our now complete survey covers 40 square degrees around
M31, extending to a major axis distance of ~60 kpc. This survey has led to the
discovery of numerous spatial density and/or colour {metallicity?} variations
within the M31 halo and outer disk, and interim results motivated a successful
Cycle 11 HST/ACS program to obtain deep colour-magnitude diagrams for six
regions exhibiting the most prominent stellar substructure known at that time,
including the giant stellar stream and the clump of stars near the anomolous
cluster, G1. The present proposal requests time to augment our Cycle 11
program with observations of two new features, a very low surface brightness
fragment lying 3 degrees north-east of center and a high surface brightness
spur of emission in the south-western half of the galaxy, which we have
discovered since 2001. Deep colour-magnitude diagrams reaching 2-3 magnitudes
below the horizontal branch will be constructed, allowing detailed
characterization of the luminous evolved stellar populations via the red giant
metallicity distribution, the luminous asymptotic giant branch, the horizontal
branch morphology and the red clump, as well as the detection of a
main-sequence that may be present from any younger component. Together the
Cycle 11 and 13 pointings target all prominent stellar substructure known to
exist within 60 kpc of M31.

We intend to use the ACS/WFC to measure structural parameters {half light
radius, King core radius and concentration parameter} of individual globular
clusters {GCs} in NGC 1399. Very little is known about structural parameters
of globular clusters as a function of radius outside the Local Group. The
proposed observations, arranged in a 3x3 ACS mosaic, will allow us to perform
the first detailed wide-field study of structural parameters of globular
clusters in a giant elliptical galaxy. In particular we will: 1} study the
size-galactocentric distance relation of globular clusters out to ~55 kpc
{~1.6 eff. radius of the GCS} and determine whether the observed differences
in sizes between metal-rich and metal-poor globular cluster in early-type
galaxies are primordial and thereby reflect fundamental differences in
formation, or are due to projection effects; 2} match the GC position observed
with HST/ACS with X-ray binaries identified over the full Chandra field, and
use the above sizes to constrain physical models for X-ray binary formation in
GCs. 3} The wealth of ground-based data available for this system
{photometry+spectroscopy}, will allow us to correlate the structural
properties with other GC properties, such as their chemical composition,

PI:         Charles Alcock

We request second epoch observations with ACS of Magellanic Cloud fields
centered on the 40 quasars in the LMC and SMC for which we have first epoch
Cycle 11 data. The new data will determine the systemic proper motion of the
Clouds. An extensive astrometric analysis of the first epoch data shows that
follow-up observations with a two year baseline will allow us to measure the
proper motion of the clouds to within 0.022 mas/year in each of the two
orthogonal directions {assuming that we can image 25 quasars, i.e., with a
realistic Snapshot Program completion rate}. The best weighted combination of
all previous measurements has a seven times larger error than what we expect.
We will determine the proper motion of the clouds with 2% accuracy. When
combined with HI data for the Magellanic Stream this will constrain both the
mass distribution in the Galactic Halo and theoretical models for the origin
of the Magellanic Stream. Previous measurements are too crude for such
constraints. Our data will provide by far the most accurate proper motion
measurement for any Milky Way satellite.

Title:	    Determining the Origin of Virgo's Intracluster Stars
PI:         Robin Ciardullo

Intracluster stars constitute about 20% of the total stellar population of a
typical galaxy cluster, and their existence provides a vital clue for our
understanding of cluster formation and evolution. However, to exploit their
probative value, we need to know their origins: are they the remnants of dwarf
galaxies, long since destroyed by the cluster potential, or have the stars
been harassed from their parent galaxies at recent epochs? To answer this
question, we propose to use the Wide-Field Channel of ACS to make an I, {V-I}
color-magnitude diagram of Virgo's intracluster stars. From the position and
morphology of the population's red giant branch, we will be able to determine
the metallicity distribution function of the stars, and thereby determine
their likely origin and ejection mechanisms. Only HST with the ACS has the
sensitivity and resolution to perform this fundamental measurement. This
program has two options. Option one uses conventional methods of cluster
photometry and requires 37 orbits of exposure time. Option two involves a
novel analysis technique, which promises to achieve most of the same science
in two-thirds the time {23 orbits}. We describe this alternative method of
analysis and demonstrate its use via simulations.

PI:         Scott Anderson

The reionization of intergalactic helium is thought to have occurred between
redshifts of about 3 and 4. The study of HeII Lyman-alpha absorption towards a
half-dozen quasars at 2.7<z<3.5 demonstrates the great potential of such
probes of the IGM, but the current critically-small sample limits confidence
in resulting cosmological inferences. The requisite unobscured quasar
sightlines to high-redshift are extremely rare, especially due to severe
absorption in random intervening Lyman-limit systems, but SDSS provides
hundreds of bright, new quasars at such redshifts potentially suitable for
HeII studies. Our cycle 13 SNAP program proposes to verify the UV
detectability of 40 new, bright, z>2.9 SDSS quasars, but with special emphasis
on extending helium studies to the highest redshift sightlines. Our proposed
approach has already proven successful, and additional sightlines will enable
follow-up spectal observations to measure the spectrum and evolution of the
ionizing background radiation, the density of intergalactic baryons, and the
epoch of reionization of the IGM.

Title:	    HST / Chandra Monitoring of a Dramatic Flare in the M87 Jet
PI:         John Biretta

As the nearest galaxy with an optical jet, M87 affords an unparalleled
opportunity to study extragalactic jet phenomena at the highest resolution.
During 2002, HST and Chandra monitoring of the M87 jet detected a dramatic
flare in knot HST-1 located ~1" from the nucleus. As of late 2003 its
brightness has increased twenty-fold in the optical band, and continues to
increase sharply; the X-rays show a similarly dramatic outburst. In both bands
HST-1 now greatly exceeds the nucleus in brightness. To our knowledge this is
the first incidence of an optical or X-ray outburst from a jet region which is
spatially distinct from the core source; this presents an unprecedented
opportunity to study the processes responsible for non-thermal variability and
the X-ray emission. We propose seven epochs of HST/STIS monitoring during
Cycle 13, as well as seven epochs of Chandra/ACIS observation {5ksec each}. We
also include a brief HRC/ACS observations that will be used to gather spectral
information and map the magnetic field structure. This monitoring is continued
into Cycles 14 and 15. The results of this investigation are of key importance
not only for understanding the nature of the X-ray emission of the M87 jet,
but also for understanding flares in blazar jets, which are highly variable,
but where we have never before been able to resolve the flaring region in the
optical or X-rays. These observations will allow us to test synchrotron
emission models for the X-ray outburst, constrain particle acceleration and
loss timescales, and study the jet dynamics associated with this flaring
component. Revisions 6 Oct 2004: Due to the demise of STIS we are replacing

Title:	    The Evolution and Assembly of Galactic Disks: Integrated studies

PI:         Marc Davis

This project is a 126-orbit imaging survey in F606W/F814W ACS to measure the
evolution of galaxy disks from redshift z = 1.4 to the present. By combining
HST imaging with existing observations in the Extended Groth Strip, we can for
the first time simultaneously determine the mass in dark matter that underlies
disks, the mass in stars within those disks, and the rate of formation of new
stars from gas in the disks, for samples of >1, 000 objects. ACS observations
are critical for this work, both for reliable identifications of disks and for
determining their sizes and inclinations. Combining these data with the
kinematics measured from high-resolution Keck DEIMOS spectra will give
dynamical masses that include dark matter. Stellar masses can be measured
separately using ground-based BRIK and Spitzer IRAC GTO data, while
cross-calibrated star formation rates will come from DEEP2 spectra, GALEX, and
Spitzer/MIPS. The field chosen is the only one where all multiwavelength data
needed will be available in the near term. These data will show how the
fundamental properties of disks {luminosity, rotation speed, scale length} and
their scaling relations have evolved since z~1, and also will measure the
build-up of stellar disks directly, providing fundamental tests of disk
formation and evolution. In addition to the above study of disk galaxies, the
data will also be used to measure the evolution of red-sequence galaxies and
their associated stellar populations. ACS images will yield the number of
red-sequence galaxies versus time, together with their total associated
stellar mass. ACS images are crucial to classify red-sequence galaxies into
normal E/S0s versus peculiar types and to measure radii, which will complete
the suite of fundamental structural parameters needed to study evolution. We
will measure the zeropoints of major scaling laws {Fundamental Plane, radius
versus sigma}, as well as evolution in characteristic quantities such as L*,
v*, and r*. Stellar population ages will be estimated from high-resolution
Keck DEIMOS spectra and compared to SED evolution measured from GALEX, HST,
Spitzer, and ground-based colors. Important for both disk and red-galaxy
programs are parallel exposures to be taken with both NIC3 {J and H} and WFPC2
{B}. These are arranged so that ACS, WFPC2, and NIC3 all overlap where
possible , providing a rich data set of galaxies imaged with all three HST
cameras from B to H. These data will be used to measure restframe visible
morphologies and UV star-formation rates for galaxies near the edge of the
survey, to discover and count EROs below the Keck spectroscopic limit of R =
24, and to provide an improved database of photometric redshifts for galaxies
in the overlap regions.

Title:	    Unveiling the Progenitors and Physics of Cosmic Explosions
PI:         Shrinivas Kulkarni

GRBs and XRFs are clearly highly asymmetric explosions and require a
long-lived power source {central engine}. In contrast, nearby core-collapse
events are essentially spherical explosions. However, the failure of spherical
neutrino driven collapses has led to the idea that asymmetric energy release
is essential for the explosion. The recent finding of a Type Ic SN in GRB
030329, the association of the low energy event GRB 980425 with SN 1998bw, the
theoretical development discussed above and the rise of collapsar models make
it timely to consider whether all these explosions contain engines. Given the
uncertainties in theoretical modeling it is clear that observations are needed
to guide models. A priori there is little reason to expect connection between
the ultra-relativistic jet that powers the GRB and the explosive
nucleosynthesis of the ~0.5 solar masses of Nickel-56 that powers the
accompanying supernova. We propose a comprehensive program of ACS photometric
searches {and measurements} for SNe associated with GRBs and XRFs. In concert,
we will undertake ground-based spectroscopy to determine velocity widths, and
measure engine parameters from pan-chromatic afterglow observations. Our goal
is to produce a comprehensive database of engine and SN physical parameters
against which theoretical modeling will be guided.

Post-asymptotic-giant-branch {PAGB} stars of spectral types A-F are the

observations, that PAGB stars have tremendous potential as highly efficient
standard candles and as tracers of halo populations and late stellar
evolution. Our analysis of PAGB stars in archival HST images of M32, based on
the equivalent of one orbit of HST time, precisely reproduces the accepted
distance. We propose to obtain ACS/WFC and WFPC2 images of fields in the halo
of M81, as another test of the PAGB method. We show that 4 orbits of HST data
will produce a distance of comparable accuracy to the much more laborious
Cepheid technique. If successful on M81, we will propose in the next cycle to
measure the distance to Virgo using our method, a distance ladder that has
only two rungs {trigonometric parallaxes of subdwarfs to calibrate PAGB stars
in globular clusters, and then PAGB stars in Virgo}.

We propose to obtain a UV spectrum of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 {NLS1} galaxy
NGC 4051 on a target-of-opportunity basis when it goes into a faint state for
the purpose of exploring the variable nature of the shape of the ionizing
continuum in this source. Previous simultaneous X-ray and optical monitoring
of this source reveals that at some times the X-rays and the He II 4686
emission line nearly disappear, while the UV/optical continuum and Balmer
lines are weaker, but present and continue to vary. This suggests that there
is a variable cutoff in the shape of the ionizing continuum, and in the faint
state this occurs at low enough energies to affect all the strong UV lines. By
comparing emission-line flux ratios in the low state to those in high states
and with photoionization equibrium calculations, we can identify the cutoff
energy. The cutoff energy may correspond to a transition radius in the
accretion disk, inside of which the source has entered into a low-radiative
efficiency mode.

PI:         Denis Grodent

Repeated imaging of Jupiter's aurora has shown that the northern main oval has
a distorted 'kidney bean' shape in the general range of 90-140? System III
longitude, which appears unchanged since 1994. While it is more difficult to
observe the conjugate regions in the southern aurora, no corresponding
distortion appears in the south. Recent improved accuracy in locating the
satellite footprint auroral emissions has provided new information about the
geometry of Jupiter's magnetic field in this and other areas. The study of the
magnetic field provides us with insight into the state of matter and the
dynamics deep down Jupiter. There is currently no other way to do this from
orbit. The persistent pattern of the main oval implies a disturbance of the
local magnetic field, and the increased latitudinal separation of the locus of
satellite footprints from each other and from the main oval implies a locally
weaker field strength. It is possible that these phenomena result from a
magnetic anomaly in Jupiter's intrinsic magnetic field, as was proposed by A.
Dessler in the 1970's. There is presently only limited evidence from the
scarcity of auroral footprints observed in this longitude range. We propose to
obtain HST UV images with specific observing geometries of Jupiter to
determine the locations of the auroral footprints of Io, Europa, and Ganymede
in cycle 13 to accurately determine the magnetic field geometry in the
suggested anomaly region, and to either confirm or refute the suggestion of a

magnesium absorption lines in the soft X-ray photospheric {Chandra} spectrum,
which suggests that H1504+65 may be a O-Ne-Mg white dwarf. We will test this

H1504+65 would be the most compelling case for the existence of single O-Ne-Mg

binaries are currently known with separations exceeding 15 AU. Only 10 dwarfs
in this sample have previous HST observations primarily at optical
wavelengths. With the increased sensitivity of our survey, we will provide the
most stringent test to date of brown dwarf models which envisage formation as
ejected stellar embryos. In addition, our observations will be capable of
detecting binaries with mass ratios as low as 0.3, and will therefore also
test the apparent preference for equal-mass ultracool binaries. Finally, our

will release a 360 kg impactor into the nucleus of the comet on July 4, 2005.
Our primary objective is to study the generation and evolution of the gaseous
coma resulting from this impact. To this end we plan to obtain ultraviolet
spectra with STIS before, during, and following the impact. As a secondary
objective we will obtain wide-band images of the visual outburst resulting
from the impact. We also plan to use the high resolution capability of the
ACS/HRC, in conjunction with the camera on board the spacecraft, two weeks
prior to impact, to determine the spatial orientation of active jets emanating
from the comet's nucleus and to assess the potential hazards of these jets to
the spacecraft.

Title:	    Physical parameters of the upper atmosphere of the extrasolar
	    planet HD209458b
PI:         Alfred Vidal-Madjar

Every 3.5 days, the transits of the gaseous planet orbiting HD209458 offer the
unique opportunity to investigate the spectral features of an extra-solar
planetary atmosphere. Using HST, we first discovered the extended upper
atmosphere of HD209458b through the detection of a 15% HI Lyman alpha
absorption. We concluded that the hydrogen must be escaping the planet with a
lower limit rate of 10^10 g/s {Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003}. Additional
observations, subsequently allowed to detect OI and CII in the upper
atmosphere implying that this atmosphere is hydrodynamically escaping {in
"blow off", Vidal-Madjar et al. 2004}. Here we propose to further study this
upper atmosphere to better constrain the "blow off" state by directly
estimating the physical conditions and the flow characteristics. In particular
we will determine the temperature and density at the base of the upper
atmosphere {the thermosphere}, and the density distribution and ionization
state just below that level. Comparison between the optical and ultraviolet
occultation light curves will provide useful information on the molecular/haze
content of the lower atmosphere. The observation of six HD209458b transits
with HRC and SBC settings will allow the detection of many lines adressing
these issues. The proposed observations will give us for the first time a
detailed probe of the atmosphere of an "evaporating" extra-solar planet.With
species as abundant as FeII or MgII, the damping wings in the strongest lines
will start to form at levels around 1.9% absorption. Due to either the
strength of the MgII doublet lines around 280 nm or the packing of FeII lines,
strong absorptions arising from the accumulated damping wings should show up
clearly in FeII and MgII. All these signatures should be easily detected even
with the 40 to 100 Angstrom resolution of the PR200L prism in these spectral
regions. In addition to these goals, any signature of molecules {e.g CO below
154 nm}, dust or haze should also show up as broad band absorption in both
PR110L and PR200L settings. The estimate of the planet radius at different
wavelengths in the UV would become possible for all efficient absorbers in
this spectral range. The achievement of 0.1% precision in the occultation
curves thus provides sensitivity high enough to potentially lead to important
discoveries.

Title:	    Solving the problem of the White Dwarf Cooling Sequence End in M4:
	    an efficent approach
PI:         Luigi Bedin

The end of the white dwarf {WD} cooling sequence {WDCS} has never been
observed, despite the importance that it has in providing an age estimate of
old stellar systems, independent from the standard method of the main sequence
turn off. The best targets for this investigation are the closest stellar
clusters, and, among them, globular clusters are the most interesting ones.
Being the oldest stellar aggregates, they allow to probe the advanced WD
cooling phases, and the independent age estimate coming from the end of their
WDCS has an important cosmological impact. M4 is the best target for this
investigation. Despite huge observational efforts, we still miss the end of
its WDCS. The ACS camera offers a unique opportunity to identify it. Coupled
with already existing observations, we here prove that we can finally reach it
with only 10 HST orbits. This is probably the last opportunity we have for a
large number of years. The data we are requesting here, will also be used to
complete other two programs of great astrophysical impact: the observational
detection of the main sequence hydrogen burning limit, and the measurement of
the geometrical distance of M4.

Title:	    Detecting the elusive low mass companion around epsilon Indi
PI:         Michael Endl

We propose coronagraphic NICMOS observations of the nearby {d = 3.6 pc} K5V
star epsilon Indi {HD 209100} to search for the unknown companion which causes
a low amplitude radial velocity {RV} trend in our 11 years of precise Doppler
measurements. This RV data set places a lower limit of 4.5 AU for the orbital
semimajor axis of this companion. Moreover, the fact that the RV trend is
lacking any sign of curvature over this long time period clearly points
towards a much larger orbital separation. Epsilon Indi also has a T dwarf
{binary} companion at a separation of 1400 AU. However, these brown dwarf
companions are too distant from the primary to induce the observed RV
variation. It is also unlikely that this nearby star has an unknown stellar {M
dwarf} companion. The RV signal is thus most probably caused by a yet unknown
giant planetary or brown dwarf companion at a separation of more than 5 AU.
Because epsilon Indi is so near to the Sun, it constitutes an ideal target for
high contrast imaging with NICMOS in its coronagraphic mode. Indeed, NICMOS
coronagraphy is capable of detecting objects down to 15 Jupiter masses at
separations greater than 2.3 arcseconds {S/N=25} - precisely the separation
and mass range indicated by our Doppler spectroscopy. Only 2 orbits of
HST/NICMOS observations could directly image the coolest and lowest mass
companion ever found around a solar-type star.

Title:	    The Masses of the Ultraluminous X-Ray Sources
PI:         Joel Bregman

Ultraluminous X-ray sources are non-nuclear sources in normal disk galaxies
that are second only to AGNs in point-source luminosity. These enigmatic
objects are either stellar mass black holes that are super-Eddington emitters,
or sub-Eddington emission from 1E3-1E4 Msolar black holes. We can distinguish
between these models by a direct determination of the mass of the primary,
which requires knowing the spectral type of the secondary, its period, and its
orbital velocity around the black hole. We propose to obtain UV spectra to
determine the spectral type of two ULX secondaries {optical counterparts}, to
infer the masses and radii of the secondaries and their suitability for radial
velocity studies. For another ULX secondary, we already obtained a UV spectrum
showing it to be a B0I star, so we propose three additional observations,
which will yield the characteristic orbital velocity, help constrain the
period, and reveal if the primary is a 1E3-1E4 Msolar black hole, which would
produce velocities > 1000 km/sec.

Title:	    The Coevolution of Supermassive Black Holes and Galaxies at z~3
PI:         Chien Peng

The existence of strong correlations between the mass of supermassive black
holes and galaxy bulge properties implies that there is an intimate connection
between their formation and evolution. How do supermassive black holes grow
and how did the correlations come about? Is the growth of supermassive black
holes coeval with the growth of the bulge, and is a bulge necessary for AGN
activity at high z? We propose to use HST NICMOS to image 9 low-luminosity
broad-line AGNs at z~3 in the restframe B-band, identified through the
Lyman-break technique. This sample is unique because the AGN luminosities are
comparable to Seyfert-like nuclei at z~3, and thus are some of the lowest that
have been selected optically. Because of the low total luminosity of the
sample, the hosts are likely to be Lyman-break galaxies, which are believed to
be the progenitor galaxies of the local Hubble sequence. The goal is to
directly detect their host galaxies and to separate the AGN, in order to study
the host galaxy morphology and luminosity. From measurement of the bulge
luminosity and black hole mass {through available spectra}, we will study the
black hole-bulge coevolution out to z~3. We will also compare the luminosity
and morphology of these faint AGN hosts with the more luminous and massive
host galaxies found in previous HST studies of quasars.

Title:	    NICMOS observations of A1689
PI:         Narciso Benitez

The potential of galaxy clusters as ``cosmic telescopes'' has been known for a
long time, but practical results in the pre-ACS era have been scarce due to
two main problems: the uncertainty in determining the magnification
distribution of the cluster {the ``optics'' of the instrument} and the
presence of numerous bright cluster galaxies which cover the field of view and
hinder the detection of background galaxies. We have developed techniques to
solve these two problems working with our ACS observations of A1689, the most
powerful lens in the sky, and for the first time we have been able to
determine the "specifications" of a cosmic telescope with a useful level of
precision, thanks to the detection and identification of more than 100
multiple images with reliable redshift information. We propose to observe the
high magnification region in the A1689 field in the F110W band with a 3x3
mosaic of NIC3 pointings; the resulting image will reach a lens-corrected
limiting magnitudes of 29.5 for point sources, surpassing in depth the UDF
NICMOS observations and providing an unique dataset with multiple scientific
returns.

Title:	    Testing the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium Paradigm
PI:         Jay Howk

Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations predict that ~30%-40% of the
low-redshift baryons reside in a collisionally ionized phase {log T ~ 5 to 7}
of the intergalactic medium {IGM} associated with large-scale, unvirialized
filaments of galaxies. Recent surveys of O VI gas have lent some support to
the presence of this warm-hot intergalactic medium {WHIM}, but the results are
significantly limited by uncertainties in the ionization mechanism {photo- vs.
collisionally ionized} and metallicity of the gas. We are pursuing a large
program to test predictions of the WHIM and to improve existing measurements
of the OVI absorbers. The primary goals are {i} to increase the redshift path
for detection of the hottest IGM, previously only accessible through X-ray
absorption studies, using EUV absorption from Ne VIII and Mg X, and {ii} to
constrain the IGM physics using UV absorption from H I Ly-alpha, C III, C IV,
and O VI. Our team has been awarded a FUSE Legacy program to probe the
moderate-redshift WHIM using unique ionization diagnostics in the restframe
EUV waveband, including O V, Ne VIII and Mg X. Here we propose to complement
our FUSE Legacy program with STIS intermediate-resolution echelle-mode
observations of five moderate-redshift {0.45 < z < 0.98} AGNs. The unique
combination of FUSE EUV and STIS UV spectra will allow us {1} to test the
current models of the WHIM by studying the ionization mechanisms responsible
for producing highly-ionized metals in the IGM and determining the frequency
of genuine high-temperature metal absorbers in the low-redshift IGM; {2} to
investigate the relationship between WHIM and large-scale galaxy structures
using galaxy redshift measurements obtained with DEIMOS on Keck and IMACS at
Las Campanas Observatory; and {3} to determine the ionization state and
metallicity of O VI absorbers in order to accurately assess their contribution
to the total baryon budget. Finally, we will make high-level science products

census of the the morphology of cluster galaxies in the cores of clusters, to
detect radial and tangential arc candidates, to detect optical jet candidates,
and to provide an approximate estimate of the shear signal of the clusters
themselves, and potentially an assessment of the contribution of large scale

Title:	    Multi-wavelength Observations of Symbiotic Stars in Outburst
PI:         Charles Keyes

To investigate the cause and nature of classical symbiotic outbursts, we
initiated a program of multi-wavelength observations of these events. As
evidence is mounting that collimated outflows {jets} may be associated with
symbiotic outbursts, we also investigate conditions needed for jet production
- a question with broad astrophysical relevance. The first target for our
campaign - the 2000-2002 outburst of Z Andromedae - confirmed the utility and
need for coordinated multi-wavelength observations to make progress in
understanding the nature of the outburst mechanisms in symbiotic stars. FUSE
data were the cornerstone of that project {which included data from the VLA,
MERLIN, ground-based spectroscopy and photometry, Chandra, and XMM, but not
HST}. Our Z And observations have motivated us to propose a new scenario that
we term the "combination nova" which is triggered by a disk-instability. To
test this new model, we received HST Cycle 12 and FUSE Cycle 4 time {through
approximately 6/2004} to continue the multi-wavelength approach with
observations at several epochs during the outburst of a second
target-of-opportunity {TOO}. That TOO has not yet been triggered. We propose
here to continue this TOO observing opportunity into Cycle 13 {to 7/2005}.
FUSE Cycle 5 observations {to mid-2005} were recently approved. Coordinated
XMM and VLA observations are also approved. The evolution of the UV spectrum
throughout the outburst plays a vital role in distinguishing between the
outburst models currently in contention for describing outburst behavior.
Analysis of our first campaign has shown that HST observations can play a
fundamental role in the multi-wavelength approach. The combination of
high-resolution STIS and FUSE-band emission and absorption features,
time-tagged observations, and continua provide a unique opportunity to probe
the structure and ionization conditions in the outburst material that can not
be accomplished with either ultraviolet region alone.

morphological confirmation of galaxy candidates lying near critical lines, and
{2} the determination of the physical scales involved in star-forming regions

Title:	    A Mini-Survey of Interstellar Abundances in the Magellanic Clouds
PI:         Daniel Welty

Studies of the interstellar medium in the Magellanic Clouds explore somewhat
different environmental conditions from those typically probed in our own
Galactic ISM. Apart from a few studies of individual sightlines, however,
little is known about the abundances and depletions in the ISM of the LMC and
SMC. HST spectra of three SMC stars indicate that Si and Mg {generally thought
to be major dust constituents} are essentially undepleted in the SMC gas ---
even for components with severe depletions of Fe and Ni. Similar "anomalous"
Si depletions have now been seen in cycle 12 STIS spectra of one LMC star,
though "normal" Si depletions are seen toward a second. Intriguingly, the
"anomalous" Si depletions are all found for sightlines which probe regions
where the 2175 A extinction bump is either absent {most of SMC} or very weak
{LMC2}. We therefore propose a mini-survey of interstellar absorption lines
toward 13 stars distributed throughout the LMC and SMC --- which would more
than double the number of Magellanic Clouds sightlines with extensive and
accurate interstellar abundance information. A single STIS E230M setting will
include lines from Zn II, Si II, Fe II, Ti II, Cr II, Ni II, and several trace
neutral species --- allowing the abundance/depletion pattern to be determined
at many locations in the two galaxies. The analysis of these spectra will have
significant implications for {1} making models of interstellar dust grains
{which currently rely heavily on silicates}; {2} understanding the
relationships between depletions, dust, and H_2 {which may be somewhat
different in the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC}; and {3} interpreting the gas-phase
abundances observed for more distant low-metallicity systems, such as the QSO
absorption-line systems {which exhibit some similar properties}.

Title:	    Saturn's Auroral Energy Deposition Coordinated with Cassini UVIS

An in-depth study of Saturn's magnetosphere and auroral processes has begun in
Jan. 2004 with coordinated HST STIS images of Saturn's aurora while the
approaching Cassini measures the solar wind. This program is expected to
establish the degree of solar wind control of Saturn's aurora. The beginning
of the Cassini orbiter tour of the Saturn system in July 2004 will offer new
opportunities for collaborative science. The energetics of Saturn's auroral
processes can best be studied via low resolution UV spectra of the emissions
and the auroral "color ratio". The geometry of the initial Cassini orbits
provides the best observing geometry for UVIS measurements of auroral
energetics when it is close to Saturn on the night side. At such times, it
will be possible to have simultaneous observations of Saturn's southern /
dayside aurora with HST STIS and the northern / nightside aurora with Cassini
UVIS. Both the distributions of the auroral emissions and the energy of the
precipitating particles can be measured simultaneously at conjugate points
north and south. This proposal is to conduct one such simultaneous
observation, which will demonstrate the potential for future cycles. We
request 5 HST orbits to observe a large fraction of one complete Saturn
rotation at the same time as Cassini UVIS. The rotational coverage has been
shown to be of central importance in recent STIS images of Saturn's auroral
activity, which is concentrated in an "active sector" connected with the
strongest SKR radio emissions.

Title:	    Bulges or disks in the centers of late-type spirals?
PI:         Marcella Carollo

In a simple view of the Hubble sequence, smaller bulges should be rescaled
versions of bigger bulges. Bulges however have been found to change their
structural properties with decreasing luminosity, approaching at the faintest
end a disk-like, exponential light profile. This indicates a complex
mass-dependent bulge formation history. Particularly, the
intermediate-to-small size bulges have been suggested to form due to secular
evolution processes within their host disks. However, the alleged small bulges
may even be 'simply' denser inner regions of the disks. Two major ingredients
are missing in order to {a} understand the nature of bulges in the
disk-dominated galaxies, {b} establish whether and which secular evolution
processes actually occur, and {c} in which mass range they are preferentially
active: {1} High-resolution numerical simulations of disk secular evolution,
to provide a quantitative basis for interpreting real data; {2} Observational
diagnostics which can break the degeneracy between very cold, dense disks and
relatively hot bulges, and to compare with the simulations. We are carrying
out a large N-body + SPH simulations campaign to settle the first issue.
Stellar kinematics are the ideal observational diagnostics. We have acquired
ground kinematic data for the medium-sized bulges. However, both the
spectroscopic and the spatial resolution requirements necessary to trace the
relative contributions of cold and hot motions become very stringent at the
faint-end of the bulge sequence: only the HST can provide radially-extended
kinematics for the smallest bulges. We therefore ask for STIS/G750M
spectroscopy to measure internal resolved stellar kinematics for two small
bulges selected from our previous HST imaging program. Even just these two
"data-points" in this unexplored mass-regime will allow significant progress
in the understanding of the origin of the Hubble sequence: Complemented by our
ground-study of the medium-sized bulges, they will allow us to establish
whether the ratio of cold-to-hot motions in bulges in the
intermediate-to-small mass regime depends on the bulge mass, and, by comparing
with our simulations, to constrain the initial conditions and physical
parameters that allow disk secular evolution processes to grow central bulges
similar to those that are observed along the entire Hubble sequence.

We request time to obtain ACS deep images of the B1608+656 gravitational lens
system to fully characterize its enclosing Einstein ring with high
signal-to-noise ratio {SNR}. These data will allow us to determine the
gravitational potential of the lens, locally, to several percent accuracy and,
combined with the three independent time delays, measure H_0 to much better
than 10% precision. For this goal, we have developed powerful new lens
modeling codes that make use of the full brightness distribution of the
Einstein ring in lens systems. The B1608+656 system is ideal for our new code.
It has precisely measured time delays, a well-determined stellar velocity
dispersion, and an Einstein ring that is not dominated by the lensed nuclear
emission of the background source. When combined with high-SNR images of
Einstein rings, the new modeling codes provide qualitatively different and
much improved analysis of the ring emission than was previously possible. The
proposed ACS observations will reach the SNR at which the new modeling code
can be fully exploited {SNR=5 per pixel}. Our simulations show that these new
data will allow us to reduce the total uncertainties in H_0 derived from the
system by at least a factor of two, to the 5-7% level for this system.

Our group has demonstrated the role that massive clusters of galaxies, acting
as powerful cosmic lenses, can play in locating sources with modest mass and
star formation rate beyond redshifts z~5-6 likely to be representative of
those responsible for cosmic reionization. The large magnifications, possible
in the critical regions of well-constrained clusters, bring sources into view
that would lie at or beyond the limits of conventional exposures such as the
UDF. Recently, using deep ACS and NICMOS imaging, we have located a low mass
source at z=7.05 whose UV continuum slope is apparently steeper than for
normal star-forming galaxies. We propose a deep ACS grism exposure to confirm
the nature of this source and further ACS and NICMOS imaging of well-studied
clusters to locate further examples. The grism spectroscopy will conclusively
determine the UV SED of this source and our 3-color survey will constrain the
redshift, star-formation rate, and SED of additional 6<z<8 sources. Over the
strongly-lensed {unlensed} area of 2.5 arcmin^2, we expect to detect 10 more
sources at z>6.5, with more than 2.5 Msun/yr of star formation {our survey
limit}. Before the advent of the next generation of observational facilities,
our search technique may represent the only way to reliably select and
characterize the likely population of galaxies during the epoch of

model for Seyfert nuclei which includes a compact, equatorial scattering
region located within the circum-nuclear torus and the 'classic' polar

The proposed multi-band imaging of one of the most dynamic regions on Jupiter

constraints to models of Jovian atmospheric dynamics. NICMOS is sensitive to
the jovian troposphere at and above the visible cloud decks. We selected six
NICMOS filters with varying levels of atmospheric opacity to observe cloud
features as they rotate from the central meridian to the limb, a strategy that
will maximize the vertical resolution of our retrievals of cloud heights, haze
opacity, and gaseous ammonia concentration. With these filters and the
excellent NICMOS spatial resolution {nearly an order of magnitude improvement
over Galileo NIMS images of the northern equatorial region}, we will determine
the smaller-scale structure of fresh NH3 clouds and provide cloud heights as
constraints for models of convection and dynamics associated with 5-micron
hotspots. HST is essential for this project, since no other observatory can
provide the necessary spatial resolution, and no ground-based or space-based

Heat conduction is one of the most fundamental processes in the interstellar

in contact with hot {10^6 -10^8 K} gas; at the contact surfaces, heat
conduction occurs and may play an essential role in the thermal structure and
evolution of the system. Observations of thermal conduction fronts have been
extremely limited. Conventionally observations use absorption lines of
collisionally ionized high ions as tracers of 1-3x10^5 K gas in the conduction
front. Such observations allow the determination of column densities but not
the relative locations of these tracer ions. Emission-line observations of a
clear-cut, edge-on conduction front are needed to study the physical structure
of a thermal conduction front. We have identified a clean-cut, edge-on
conduction front in the circumstellar bubble S308, using XMM-Newton X-ray
observations and ground-based optical images and spectra. We request HST STIS
spectroscopic observations of the NV and CVI emission lines in the transition
region from the hot interior gas to the cool nebular shell. These
observations, combined with our complementary observations at optical, FUV,
and X-ray wavelength, allow us to determine the spatially-resolved temperature
profile of a thermal conduction front. Comparisons with models further allow

NGC 3603 is the most massive, visible giant HII region in our Galaxy and
virtually a clone of R136, the famous supercluster in the core of the 30 Dor
region in the LMC. NGC 3603 harbors three young, extremely luminous, hot stars
which mimic the spectral appearance of WN6ha stars. As tailored atmosphere
analysis reveals, these stars are unevolved, very massive stars on the main
sequence. In fact, these stars have the potential of being the most massive
main sequence stars known in our Galaxy. One of these WN6ha stars is a
double-eclipsing binary with a 3.7724d period. We propose here to use HST/STIS
to carry out, for the first time, repeated, high-quality spectroscopy of this
binary in order to derive Keplerian orbits for both components and thus
directly measure their masses. Additional photometry will considerably refine
the solution for the inclination angle. Whether or not the mass of the WN6ha
{and possibly also its companion} star significantly exceeds 60 M_sol, the
current directly-observed, upper limit of main sequence stars, will allow us
to put models for massive stars to the test. As a by-product of our
observations, we will also monitor the two remaining WN6ha stars in NGC 3603.
At least one of them shows strong indications for binarity.

Title:	    HD 62542: Probing the Bare, Dense Core of an Interstellar Cloud
PI:         Daniel Welty

The line of sight to HD 62542 is remarkable for its unusual UV extinction,
high column densities of various molecules, and apparent dearth of diffuse
atomic gas. The main interstellar cloud appears to be a small, dense {n_H ~
500--1000 cm^-3}, molecular knot whose more diffuse outer layers have been
stripped away by stellar winds and shocks. As such, it provides an ideal venue
for investigating the properties of dense, molecular gas --- with minimal
confusion from any associated diffuse gas. We propose to obtain high
resolution, moderately high S/N STIS spectra of C I, CO and its isotopomers,
C_2, C II, O I, and many other atomic species. Those data will be used to
compare various diagnostics of the physical conditions {e.g., C I and O I fine
structure excitation, CO and C_2 rotational excitation}, to determine the
relative abundances of the various CO isotopomers {fractionation}, and to
determine the depletions of various elements in dense gas {the predicted
severe depletions have likely been masked by associated diffuse gas in other
cases}. Understanding the fractionation and excitation of CO in this
relatively simple case will aid in understanding its behavior in other more
complex regions {important because CO and its isotopomers are often used to
trace and characterize molecular gas when H_2 cannot be measured}.

Title:	    Determination of orbits and colors for two new binaries in the

PI:         William Merline

We propose to measure color and orbital properties of two asteroid binaries in
the Koronis family discovered in our SNAP-9747 survey. The best previously
studied asteroid binary system, Ida/Dactyl, is also in the Koronis family.
Differential space weathering measured on the Ida and Dactyl surfaces has been
a powerful constraint on models of satellite formation mechanisms and
satellite survivability. HST offers the unique opportunity for similar
measurements of these much smaller, main-belt binaries. The new satellites are
believed to have formed through different collisional mechanisms than
Ida/Dactyl. Further, with a set of 4 relative position measurements for each
of the two systems, added to the discovery snapshots, we will determine and
compare the densities of the primaries with Ida {a large, 31.5 km, asteroid
with density 2.6+-0.5 g/cm^3, measured by the Galileo flyby}. In contrast,
{17246} and {22899} are 4.5 km bodies that are likely to have been
restructured since the family-forming event by subsequent collisions. As all
are members of the same family, differences in density would constrain bulk
composition and internal structure {e.g. shard vs. rubble-pile}. Hence, these
measurements are likely to further elucidate the mechanisms for formation of
satellites.

orbiting other stars.  The field is a twelve by twelve degree square in
Cygnus.  It abuts the GE.  The detection technique is to search
photometrically for planetary transits.  Faint eclipsing binaries that are not
spatially resolved from the target star by Kepler may cause confusion, leading
to false positive detections.  The HST is uniquely capable of determining the
potential magnitude of the issue in the region of the GE, where stellar

Title:	    Imaging of Ices in Circumstellar Disks
PI:         Alycia Weinberger

The link between the material of the interstellar medium and the ultimate
composition of planets lies in the way gas and dust are processed in
circumstellar disks. Planet formation models rely upon a knowledge of the disk
constituents and temperature profiles to simulate how small grains eventually
combine into terrestrial planets and gas giant cores. Disks around other stars
may be analogs for our own early Solar System and thus allow the direct
measurement of such phenomena. Only recently, however, have well-resolved
images of dust disks around several late T Tauri or main sequence stars been
secured. HST provides a uniquely stable platform for making such sensitive
high dynamic range images. Now, for those handful of disks already resolved,
we are able to go beyond the discovery phase and begin making astrophysical
measurements to deepen our understanding of the course of disk evolution. We
therefore propose a multi-wavelength study with NICMOS designed to discover
the spatial distribution of two common Solar System materials -- methane and
water ices -- in other systems.

HST's high-contrast capabilities provide exciting imaging of circumstellar
debris disks with complex structures. In particular, broad-band imaging using
the coronagraphs in NICMOS and STIS has elucidated the disk morphology of HR
4796A exquisitely, but can only provide colors, not detailed compositional
information on its dust. With spectra, we will measure the detailed albedo of
the disk dust over a large wavelength range and search for interstellar
medium-like molecules and water ice. We will also use our spatially resolved
spectra for very high angular resolution profiles of the disk width to
constrain models for planets circling inside the dust. We have demonstrated in
a previous program how to use STIS for spatially resolved disk spectroscopy.
We now propose to use our technique to study HR 4796A.

PI:         Almudena Alonso-Herrero

Luminous Infrared Galaxies {LIRGs, LIR = 10^11-10^12Lsol} and Ultraluminous
Infrared Galaxies {LIR>10^12Lsol} account for approximately 75% of all the
galaxies detected in the mid-infrared in the redshift range z=0-1.5. In the
local universe it is found that LIRGs are predominantly powered by intense
star formation {SF}. However, the physical conditions and processes governing
such dramatic activity over scales of tens to a few hundred parsecs are poorly
known. In the last decade HST has been playing a significant role, mainly with
the discovery of super star cluters {SSCs}, and more recently, giant HII
regions. Based on observations of a few LIRGs, we found that these giant HII
regions and associated SSCs appear to be more common in LIRGs than in normal
galaxies, and may dominate the star formation activity in LIRGs. A larger
sample is required to address fundamental questions. We propose an HST/NICMOS
targeted campaign of a volume limited sample {v<5200km/s} of 24 LIRGs. This
proposal will probe the role of giant HII regions in the overall energetics of
the current star formation, their relation to SSCs, and the dependence of star
formation properties on other parameters of LIRGs. Such detailed knowledge of
the SF properties of LIRGs in the local universe is essential for
understanding galaxies at high redshift.

We propose Snapshot observations of Uranus and Neptune to monitor changes in

rapidly approaching equinox in 2007, with another 4 degrees of latitude
becoming visible every year. Recent HST observations during this epoch
{including 6818: Hammel, Lockwood, and Rages; 7885: Hammel, Karkoschka, and
Marley; 8680: Hammel, Rages, Lockwood, and Marley; and 8634: Rages, Hammel,
Lockwood, Marley, and McKay} have revealed strongly wavelength-dependent
latitudinal structure and the presence of numerous visible-wavelength cloud
features in the northern hemisphere. Long-term ground-based observations
{Lockwood and Thompson 1999} show seasonal brightness changes whose origins
are not well understood. Recent near-IR images of Neptune obtained using
adaptive optics on the Keck Telesccope together with images from our Cycle 9
Snapshot program {8634} show a general increase in activity at south temperate
latitudes as well as the possible development of another Great Dark Spot.
Further Snapshot observations of these two dynamic planets will elucidate the
nature of long-term changes in their zonal atmospheric bands and clarify the
processes of formation, evolution, and dissipation of discrete albedo
features.

PI:         George Pavlov

PSR J0437-4715 is the nearest and the brightest millisecond {recycled} pulsar,
and the only one detected at near-optical wavelengths. We detected it with the
HST STIS/FUV-MAMA detector and found that its FUV spectrum is consistent with
being emitted from the neutron star surface with a temperature of about 0.1
MK, surprisingly high for such an old object. We also found evidence of an
emission line at 1372 A, tentatively interpreted as a Zeeman component of the
hydrogen Ly-alpha line in a magnetic field of 700 MG. Unfortunately, the
spectrum was imaged in a region of strong detector background, which strongly
hampered the spectral and timing analyses. We propose to re-observe the pulsar
with the FUV-MAMA, placing the target in a low-background region, and also
observe it with the NUV-MAMA to obtain the spectrum and pulsations in a broad
UV range. The spectral analysis will allow us to measure the temperature of
the full neutron star surface and test the origin of the heating of old
neutron stars. Confirmation of the spectral line would lead to a first direct
measuremnt of the magnetic field and radius of a spin-powered neutron star and
uniquely constrain the equation of state of superdense matter. The NUV
spectrum and pulsations will also probe the magnetospheric emission and the
thermal structure of the cool white dwarf companion.

PI:         Richard de Grijs

Recent ground-based observations have revealed that the highly reddened
Galactic cluster Westerlund 1 is the current best and by far the nearest
"Young Massive Star Cluster" {YSC} candidate, i.e. a young {< 10 Myr}, dense
and massive {> 10, 000 Mo} object of which until recently 30 Doradus in the
LMC was believed to be the nearest example. However, extrapolations of the
locally derived cluster luminosity function indicate that perhaps up to a
hundred similar objects should exist within the Galaxy. The close-up view of a
YSC provided by Westerlund 1 allows us to obtain an unprecedented glimpse of
the process of massive cluster formation, evolution and fate, which are among
the very key issues in modern astrophysics. Utilising deep ACS and NICMOS
imaging and sophisticated N-body and Monte Carlo simulations, we will address
key questions regarding Westerlund 1's nature, formation and dynamical
evolution. These include, What are the initial conditions with which
Westerlund 1 was born? To what degree was mass segregation really primordial?
Has the binary fraction changed during the short cluster lifetime? Do we
expect the cluster to have a population of stellar-mass black holes? Does the
cluster harbour an intermediate-mass black hole in its core? Is Westerlund 1
unique as a Galactic YSC? How similar is the cluster to the massive "Arches"
and "Quintuplet" Galactic Centre clusters, and to 30 Doradus? With an expected
life-span of > 100 Myr, it is conceivable that there should be more YSCs like
Westerlund 1 in the Galactic disk. Our dynamical simulations will help us
determine the ultimate fate of such clusters, allowing us to at least begin to
answer the question of Westerlund 1's uniqueness in the context of the
Galaxy's stellar populations.

Radio galaxies are an important class of extragalactic objects: they are one
of the most energetic astrophysical phenomena and they provide an exceptional
probe of the evolving Universe, lying typically in high density regions but
well-represented across a wide redshift range. In earlier Cycles we carried
out extensive HST observations of the 3CR sources in order to acquire a
complete and quantitative inventory of the structure, contents and evolution
of these important objects. Amongst the results, we discovered new optical
jets, dust lanes, face-on disks with optical jets, and revealed point-like
nuclei whose properties support FR-I/BL Lac unified schemes. Here, we propose
to obtain NICMOS infrared images of 3CR sources with z<0.3 as a major
enhancement to an already superb dataset. We aim to deshroud dusty galaxies,
study the underlying host galaxy free from the distorting effects of dust,
locate hidden regions of star formation and establish the physical
characteristics of the dust itself. We will measure frequency and spectral
energy distributions of point-like nuclei, expected to be stronger and more
prevelant in the IR, seek spectral turnovers in known synchrotron jets and
find new jets. We will strongly test unified AGN schemes and merge these data
with existing X-ray to radio observations. The resulting database will be an
incredibly valuable resource to the astronomical community for years to come.

PI:         Leon Koopmans

Gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics provide two complementary methods
to determine the mass distribution and evolution of luminous and dark-matter
in early-type {E/S0} galaxies. The combined study of stellar dynamics and
gravitational lensing allows one to break degeneracies inherent to each method
separately, providing a clean probe of the internal structure of massive
galaxies. Since most lens galaxies are at redshifts z=0.1-1.0, they also
provide the required look-back time to study their structural and
stellar-population evolution. We recently analyzed 5 E/S0 lens galaxies
between z=0.5 and 1.0, combining exquisite Hubble Space Telescope imaging data
with kinematic data from ground-based Keck spectroscopy, placing the first
precise constraints on the dark-matter mass fraction and its inner slope
beyond the local Universe. To expand the sample to ~30 systems -- required to
study potential trends and evolution in the E/S0 mass profiles -- we propose
to target the 49 E/S0 lens-galaxy candidates discovered by Bolton et al.
{2004} from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey {SDSS}. With the average lens rate
being 40% and some systems having a lensing probability close to unity, we
expect to discover ~20 strong gravitational lenses from the sample. This will
triple the current sample of 9 E/S0 systems, with data in hand. With the
sample of 30 systems, we will be able to determine the average slope of the
dark-matter and total mass profile of E/S0 galaxies to 10% and 4% accuracy,
respectively. If present, we can simultaneously detect 10% evolution in the
total mass slope with 95% confidence. This will provide unprecedented
constraints on E/S0 galaxies beyond the local Universe and allow a stringent
test of their formation scenarios and the standard cosmological model.

Title:	    STIS Snapshot Survey of Boron Abundances in Early-B Stars
PI:         Charles Proffitt

Boron abundances in massive stars provide a unique constraint for new
theoretical models of stellar evolution that include rotation. We propose to
use STIS to measure the B III doublet near 2066 Angstroms in a large sample of
early-B stars. A high priority will be placed on obtaining abundances for
several stars in each of a number of different young clusters, assocations,
and star forming regions. This will allow quantitative comparision with
theoretical predictions of rotationally driven mixing in early B stars as
function of mass, age, and rotation rate. Since boron abundance measurements
are not possible for large vsin{i} values, and sin{i} is not known for
individual stars, a large sample is required to statistically test the
predictions of boron depletion as a function of the true rotation rate. For
bright nearby stars {25 targets} we will use the G230MB grating and obtain
very high S/N {>200:1}. This avoids the need for an ND filter which would
discard 99% of the photons. Spectral synthesis techniques will allow us to
derive accurate abundances despite the moderate resolution of this grating,
even for stars with relatively high vsin{i} values. This is especially
important in testing rotational models, as current abundance measurements are
mostly for stars with much lower than average rotation rates. For fainter,
more distant stars {27 targets} we will use the E230M or E230H grating with
the 0.2x0.2 aperture.

A systematic imaging search for extra-solar Jovian planets is now possible
thanks to recent progress in identifying "young stars near Earth". For most of
the proposed young {<~ 30 Myrs} and nearby {<~ 60 pc} targets, we can detect a
few Jupiter-mass planets as close as a few tens of AUs from the primary stars.
This represents the first time that potential analogs of our solar system -
that is planetary systems with giant planets having semi-major axes comparable
to those of the four giant planets of the Solar System - come within the grasp
of existing instrumentation. Our proposed targets have not been observed for
planets with the Hubble Space Telescope previously. Considering the very
successful earlier NICMOS observations of low mass brown dwarfs and planetary
disks among members of the TW Hydrae Association, a fair fraction of our
targets should also turn out to posses low mass brown dwarfs, giant planets,
or dusty planetary disks because our targets are similar to {or even better
than} the TW Hydrae stars in terms of youth and proximity to Earth. Due to the
recent cancellation of SM4, HST will inevitably degrade into a 2-gyro mode
soon and high contrast survey programs like our own cannot be carried out with
two gyros. This means that the HST cycle 13 may be the last chance to find
young Solar System analogs in the coming decade. Should HST time be awarded

PI:         Glenn Schneider

Until recently, despite decades of concerted effort applied to understanding
the formation processes that gave birth to our solar system, the detailed
morphology of circumstellar material that must eventually form planets has
been virtually impossible to discern. The advent of high contrast,
coronagraphic imaging as implemented with the instruments aboard HST has
dramatically enhanced our understanding of natal planetary system formation.
Even so, only a handful of evolved disks {~ 1 Myr and older} have been imaged
and spatially resolved in light scattered from their constituent grains. To
elucidate the physical processes and properties in potentially planet-forming
circumstellar disks, and to understand the nature and evolution of their
grains, a larger spatially resolved and photometrically reliable sample of
such systems must be observed. Thus, we propose a highly sensitive
circumstellar disk imaging survey of a well-defined and carefully selected
sample of YSOs {1-10 Myr T Tau and HAeBe stars} and {> app 10 Myr} main
sequence stars, to probe the posited epoch of planetary system formation, and
to provide this critically needed imagery. Our resolved images will shed light
on the spatial distributions of the dust in these thermally emissive disks. In
combination with their long wavelength SEDs the physical properties of the
grains will be discerned, or constrained by our photometrically accurate
surface brightness sensitivity limits for faint disks which elude detection.
Our sample builds on the success of the exploratory GTO 7233 program, using
two-roll per orbit PSF-subtracted NICMOS coronagraphy to provide the highest
detection sensitivity to the smallest disks around bright stars which can be
imaged with HST. Our sample will discriminate between proposed evolutionary
scenarios while providing a legacy of cataloged morphologies for interpreting
mid- and far-IR SEDs that the recently launched Spitzer Space Telescope will
deliver. This project cannot be done from the ground, and becomes untenable
for HST after Cycle 13 under the anticipated use of two-gyro pointing control

PI:         Dean Hines

The formation of planetary systems is intimately linked to the dust population
in circumstellar disks, thus understanding dust grain evolution is essential
to advancing our understanding of how planets form. By combining {1} the high
resolution polarimetric capabilities of ACS and NICMOS, {2} powerful 3-D
radiative transfer codes, and {3} observations of objects known to span the
earliest stellar evolutionary phases, we will gain crucial insight into the
initial phases of dust grain growth: evolution away from an ISM distribution.
Fractional polarization is a strong function of wavelength, therefore by
comparing polarimetric images in the optical and infrared, we can sensitively
constrain not only the geometry and optical depth of the scattering medium,
but also the grain size distribution. By observing objects representative of
the earliest evolutionary sequence of YSOs, we will be able to investigate how
the dust population evolves in size and distribution during the crucial
transition from a disk+envelope system to a disk+star system. The proposed
study will help to establish the fundamental time scales for the initial
depletion of ISM-like grains: the first step in understanding the
transformation from small submicron sized dust grains, to large millimeter
sized grains, and untimely to planetary bodies.

The massive black hole Sgr A* at the Galactic center has recently shown not
only quiescent emission at near-IR wavelengths, but also flare activity with
quasi-periodicity of 17 minutes. Our research group has been granted two
blocks of observing time with XMM-Newton to monitor the spectral and temporal
properties of Sgr A*. Simultaneously with these X-ray observations, we will
also monitor Sgr A* at radio, submillimeter, near-IR, and gamma-ray
wavelengths. We propose to use NICMOS in parallel with the XMM observations to
provide evidence of a well-defined minimum periodicity in the spectrum of
flare periodicities. This, combined with periodicity in the near-IR line
emission, would strengthen the claim that the emitting gas resides at the
innermost stable circular orbit around the GC black hole, thus measuring the
spin parameter of a massive black hole. Current groundbased near-IR data
suggest a spin parameter of ~0.5. In addition, the correlation pattern of
emission over a wide spectrum would elucidate a key issue of how to explain
the low luminosity of Sgr A*. The NICMOS on HST is the only instrument that
can accurately measure the 17 minute quasi-periodic variability of Sgr A*
because of the long time baseline over which HST can observe Sgr A* in
parallel with XMM-Newton.

Recent observations suggest that very low-mass galaxies in the local universe
are still in the process of formation. To investigate this issue we propose to
obtain deep ACS HRC images in the U, V and I bands of a sample of 11
"ultracompact" blue dwarf galaxies {UCBDs} identified in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. These objects are nearby {z < 0.009}, actively star-forming, and have
extremely small angular and physical sizes {d < 6" and D < 1 kpc}. They also
tend to reside in voids. Our WFPC2 images of the prototype object of this
class, POX 186, reveal this tiny object to have a highly disturbed morphlogy
indicative of a recent {within 10^8 yr} collision between two small {~ 100 pc}
clumps of stars that could represent the long-sought building blocks predicted
by the Press-Schechter model of hierarchical galaxy formation. This collision
has also triggered the formation of a "super" star cluster {SSC} at the
object's core that may be the progenitor of a globular cluster. POX 186 thus
appears to be a very small dwarf galaxy in the process of formation. This
exciting discovery strongly motivates HST imaging of a full sample of UCBDs in
order to determine if they have morphologies similar to POX 186. HST images
are essential for resolving the structure of these objects, including
establishing the presence of SSCs. HST also offers the only way to determine
their morphologies in the near UV. The spectra of the objects available from
the SDSS will also allow us to measure their star formation rates, dust
content and metallicities. In addition to potentially providing the first
direct evidence of Press-Schechter building blocks, these data could yield
insight into the relationship between galaxy and globular cluster formation,
and will serve as a test of the recent "downsizing" model of galaxy formation
in which the least massive objects are the last to form.

The recent surprising discovery of six unusually bright {r~20 mag} Lyman break
galaxy {LBG} candidates with z=2.45-2.80 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
{SDSS} raises a number of questions that only HST can address. Specifically,
what is the true nature of these objects, and what role if any is played by
gravitational lensing? We propose to use the superior resolution and
sensitivity of ACS and NICMOS to obtain deep images of these objects and their
environments. Compared to SDSS images, HST will allow us to determine their
morphologies {extended, point-source, or lensed}, the appearance of their
environments {rich or poor}, and to detect any faint foreground groups or
clusters that might be responsible for lensing these objects. All outcomes
would be intruiging. If the objects are lensed, it increases from 1
{MS1512-cB58} to 7 the number of normal LBGs bright enough to study
individually. If they are instead unlensed point sources, they will represent
a new class of previously unidentified absorption-line quasars. Finally, if
they are unlensed and extended star-forming galaxies, they are at least 4mag
brighter than L_* LBGs, thus making them the most luminous star-forming
objects yet seen, representing a heretofore unknown extreme population of

such as cosmic chemical evolution. At present, the progenitors of SNe Ia and
the exact explosion mechanisms are still poorly understood, as are
evolutionary effects on SN Ia peak luminosities. Since early-time UV spectra
and light curves of nearby SNe Ia can directly address these questions, we
propose an approach consisting of two observational components: {1} Detailed
studies of two very bright, young, nearby SNe Ia with HST UV spectroscopy at
13 epochs within the first 1.5 months after discovery; and {2} studies of
correlations with luminosity for five somewhat more distant Hubble-flow SNe
Ia, for which relative luminosities can be determined with precision, using 8
epochs of HST UV spectroscopy and/or broad-band imaging. The HST data, along
with extensive ground-based optical to near-IR observations, will be analyzed
with state-of-the-art models to probe SN Ia explosion physics and constrain
the nature of the progenitors. The results will form the basis for the next
phase of precision cosmology measurements using SNe Ia, allowing us to more
fully capitalize on the substantial past {and future} investments of time made
with HST in observations of high-redshift SNe Ia.

Title:	    A Deep Far-UV Search for the Interacting Binary Population in M80
PI:         Christian Knigge

We propose to carry out a deep, far-ultraviolet {FUV}, time-resolved survey
for cataclysmic variables {CVs} and other dynamically-formed objects in the
globular cluster {GC} M80. This will include a search for FUV counterparts to
the 17 Chandra sources in our field of view, which include 2 LMXBs and 5 X-ray
selected CV candidates. Our goal is to confirm these sources as interacting
binaries and find any additional CVs below the Chandra detection limit. We
will achieve this with 6 orbits of FUV imaging with the ACS/SB, plus one
additional orbit of NUV imaging with ACS/HRC. Since crowding is not a problem
in the FUV, this will yield time-resolved FUV photometry of all blue objects
in the cluster core. Our CV census will be both deep enough to be essentially
complete and ``broad'' enough to involve all of the following CV
characteristics: {1} UV brightness; {2} blue FUV spectral shape; {3} strong
CIV and HeII emission; {4} short time-scale {$sim$ minutes} variability
{flickering, WD spin}; {6} intermediate time-scale {$sim$ hours} variability
{orbital variations}; {7} long time-scale {$sim$ weeks} variability {dwarf
nova eruptions}. We will thus uncover the interacting binary population in
M80. In addition, our survey will detect numerous blue stragglers and hot
white dwarfs, as well as any other blue objects in the central regions of this
cluster.

PI:         David Zurek

Our reductions of archival STIS/FUV-MAMA data {AR9225} have discovered 13
completely unexpected and unexplained Ultraviolet bright variables. Eleven of
the variables have been identified with evolved stars {Horizontal Branch or
Asymptotic Giant Branch}. The total number and nature of these systems is
completely unknown. If these variables are binaries the implication is that
the binary fraction {up to 25%} in NGC 1851 is the highest in all Galactic
globular clusters. The radial distributions of the variables and the blue
horizontal branch stars imply a common origin and perhaps an explanation of
the bi-modal morphology of the horizontal branch in the color magnitude
diagrams of globular clusters. These variables may be the tip of the iceberg
and a critical clue concerning the infamous "second parameter". We propose to
observe NGC 1851 on three occasions with the same setup as the archival data
to determine the total number and periods of the ultraviolet variables.

Title:	    When does Bipolarity Impose itself on the Extreme Mass Outflows
	    from AGB Stars? An ACS SNAPshot Survey
PI:         Raghvendra Sahai

Essentially all well-characterized preplanetary nebulae {PPNe} -- objects in
transition between the AGB and planetary nebula evolutionary phases - are
bipolar, whereas the mass-loss envelopes of AGB stars are strikingly
spherical. In order to understand the processes leading to bipolar
mass-ejection, we need to know at what stage of stellar evolution does
bipolarity in the mass-loss first manifest itself? Our previous SNAPshot
surveys of a PPNe sample {with ACS & NICMOS} show that roughly half our
targets observed are resolved, with well-defined bipolar or multipolar
morphologies. Spectroscopic surveys of our sample confirm that these objects
have not yet evolved into planetary nebulae. Thus, the transformation from
spherical to aspherical geometries has already fully developed by the time
these dying stars have become preplanetary nebulae. From this new and
surprising result, we hypothesize that the transformation to bipolarity begins
during the very late AGB phase, and happens very quickly, just before, or as
the stars are evolving off the AGB. We propose to test this hypothesis
quantitatively, through a SNAPshot imaging survey of very evolved AGB stars
which we believe are nascent preplanetary nebulae; with our target list being
drawn from published lists of AGB stars with detected heavy mass-loss {from
millimeter-wave observations}. This survey is crucial for determining how and
when the bipolar geometry asserts itself. Supporting kinematic observations
using long-slit optical spectroscopy {with the Keck}, millimeter and radio
interferometric observations {with OVRO, VLA & VLBA} are being undertaken. The
results from this survey {together with our previous work} will allow us to
draw general conclusions about the onset of bipolar mass-ejection during late
stellar evolution, and will provide crucial input for theories of post-AGB
stellar evolution. Our survey will produce an archival legacy of long-standing
value for future studies of dying stars.

Title:	    A Lyman-alpha Snapshot Survey of FBS and SBS Galaxies
PI:         Claus Leitherer

Search strategies for primeval galaxies rely on the assumption that
Lyman-alpha can be powered by photoionization from hot stars. Theoretical
models, however, indicate that Lyman-alpha is far from being a pure
recombination line: absorption and scattering in the interstellar medium and
the kinematics of outflowing gas make firm predictions for the Lyman-alpha
strength difficult. Therefore observational tests are required. A sample of 42
galaxies with active star formation has been selected from the First and
Second Byurakan Survey to perform such a test. The target galaxies belong to
the spectral class s1, implying they are H II galaxies, blue compact dwarfs,
or nuclear starbursts. This sample is optimized to address whether local
starbursts are strong Lyman-alpha emitters. We propose to obtain STIS G140L
spectra of the galaxies in order to detect Lyman-alpha emission with
equivalent widths larger than 5 Angstroms in this statistically significant,
homogeneous sample. We will utilize the existing, extensive body of
ground-based data to model the stellar population and make a prediction for
the Lyman-alpha emission assuming pure recombination and no radiative transfer
effects by gas and dust. Comparison with the observations will provide
constraints on such effects. The scientific goals are twofold: First, we make
an effort to understand how an apparently simple line, such as Lyman-alpha,
can be affected by radiative transfer effects and geometries in the
interstellar medium of typical star-forming regions. Second, the proposed
study will serve as an empirical test for the probability to succeed in
detecting Lyman-alpha in more distant systems. Therefore, a high-level goal of
this project is to provide guidelines for search strategies for primeval
galaxies at high redshift. This project is ideally suited for execution in
Snapshot mode.

Title:	    Direct imaging of the progenitors of massive, core-collapse
	    supernovae
PI:         Stephen Smartt

Modern supernovae searches in the nearby Universe are discovering large
numbers of SNe which have massive star progenitors {Types II, Ib and Ic}. The
extensive HST image archives of galaxies within ~20Mpc enables their
individual bright stellar content to be resolved. As massive, evolved stars
are the most luminous single objects in a galaxy, the progenitors of
core-collapse SNe should be directly detectable on pre-explosion images. In
our ongoing HST programme we have detected the first red supergiant progenitor
of a normal type II supernova, shown that SN 1993J came from a binary system,
and set direct mass-limits on three other type II supernovae progenitors.
These discoveries are providing strong constraints on theoretical models of
pre-supernova stellar evolution that predict which stars produce which type of
supernovae. We request time to continue this successful project, and require
ACS observations of future SNe which are discovered in galaxies closer than
20Mpc which have pre-explosion HST archive images available. These
observations will allow the SNe to be precisely positioned on the
pre-explosion frames with the required astrometric accuracy of around 0.05",
and provide 3-colour photometry of the surrounding stellar populations for
reddening estimations. The goal of this project is to directly identify the
progenitor stars of core-collapse supernovae. We will compare the results to
our own stellar evolutionary tracks in order to determine masses or
restrictive mass-limits for the progenitors.

We propose new observations of "The Antennae" {NGC 4038/39}, the nearest and
youngest example of a major disk-disk merger, with NICMOS and ACS. The long
overdue NICMOS observations will allow us to penetrate the dust in the Overlap
Region, measure the P_alpha emission and CO band strengths of young clusters,
and study supernova remnants in heavily obscured regions using [FeII] images.
The high resolution {0.05" pixel} ACS observations will allow us for the first
time to reliably distinguish clusters from stars based on their apparent
sizes, and to potentially identify hundreds of supernova remnants that may
control the energy balance and feedback mechanisms within the ISM {based on
[SII] images}. In conjunction with our previous WFPC2, GHRS, and STIS
observations, the new data will provide answers to fundamental questions such
as: How do these clusters form and evolve? How quickly are they destroyed and
what fraction of the field stars were formed in clusters. How many clusters
are hidden by dust? How do the clusters and associated supernovae affect the
local and global ISM? What are the dynamical masses of the clusters, and are
the stellar IMF's truncated? Simultaneous parallel observations will also
determine whether clusters can form in the more quiescent environment of the
inner tails. A better understanding of how mergers form tremendous numbers of
clusters and stars in the local universe will help shed light on processes
that are crucial during galaxy assembly throughout the observable universe.

Title:	    PANS-Probing Acceleration Now with Supernovae
PI:         Adam Riess

Type Ia supernovae {SNe Ia} provide the most direct evidence for an
accelerating Universe, a result widely attributed to dark energy. Using HST in
Cycle 11 we extended the Hubble diagram with 6 of the 7 highest-redshift SNe
Ia known, all at z>1.25, providing conclusive evidence of an earlier epoch of
cosmic deceleration. The full sample of 16 new SNe Ia match the cosmic
concordance model and are inconsistent with a simple model of evolution or
dust as alternatives to dark energy. Understanding dark energy may be the
biggest current challenge to cosmology and particle physics. To understand the
nature of dark energy, we seek to measure its two most fundamental properties:
its evolution {i.e., dw/dz}, and its recent equation of state {i.e., w{z=0}}.
SNe Ia at z>1, beyond the reach of the ground but squarely within the reach of
HST with ACS, are crucial to break the degeneracy in the measurements of these
two basic aspects of dark energy. The SNe Ia we have discovered and measured
with HST in Cycle 11, now double the precision of our knowledge of both
properties. Here we propose to quadruple the sample of SNe Ia at z>1 in the
next two cycles, complementing on-going surveys from the ground at z<1, and
again doubling the precision of dark energy constraints. Should the current
best fit model prove to be the correct one, the precision expected from the
current proposal will suffice to rule out a cosmological constant at the 99%
confidence level. Whatever the result, these objects will provide the basis
with which to extend our empirical knowledge of this newly discovered and
dominant component of the Universe, and will remain one of the most
significant legacies of HST. In addition, our survey and follow-up data will
greatly enhance the value of the archival data within the target Treasury

We will obtain deep, panchromatic imaging photometry of stellar populations in
four fields ranging from 0.5 to 4 scale lengths across the disk of the Local
Group spiral M33. The observations are designed to detect the oldest
main-sequence turnoffs in three outer disk fields, and to reach the crowding
limit in the innermost field. We will combine the photometry data with
information we already have in-hand on abundances from stars and H II regions
in M33 to derive the star formation history and metallicity evolution of the
M33 disk. The information from our four fields will allow us to obtain {1} the
ages of the oldest disk stars and the radial variation of their ages; {2} the
radial variation of the star formation history and its nature {e.g., constant,
declining, or bursting}; and {3} the metallicity distribution in each field
and the time evolution of the metallicity gradient. Our team, an experienced
mix of photometrists, spectroscopists, and galaxy evolution theorists, will
use the results from this program to construct a comprehensive chemo-dynamical
model for the M33 disk. This detailed study of M33 will be a key in developing
an understanding of the formation and evolution of disks that can be applied
to studies of disks at both low and high redshift, and will also yield a

Title:	    A Fundamental Test of Accretion Physics with NGC 4203
PI:         Joseph Shields

The rapid evolution of quasars indicates that supermassive black holes in
galaxy nuclei spend most of their time in a relatively quiescent state.
Studies of nearby galaxies demonstrate that many such black holes are
accreting at a low rate, and appear as low-luminosity active galactic nuclei
{LLAGNs}. Theoretical arguments suggest that the mode of accretion onto a
central black hole may be very different in LLAGNs as compared to
high-luminosity systems. The LINER NGC 4203 provides an excellent opportunity
to investigate quantitatively the accretion process in a LLAGN, and hence the
typical accretion state for a supermassive black hole. Cycle 7 STIS data
acquired at one position angle reveal double-peaked H-alpha emission in the
nucleus that may trace an accretion disk, and spatially resolved emission that
places an upper limit on black-hole mass. We propose observations with STIS to
map the two-dimensional velocity field of the circumnuclear gas disk in the
central regions of NGC 4203, in order to measure the black-hole mass. This
parameter is essential for testing theoretical models of accretion,
determining the mass accretion rate, and estimating the radiative efficiency
for accreted matter. The results will be important for making sense of LLAGNs,
and for translating their measured luminosity into accretion rates that trace
the growth of black holes.

I propose to observe a disappearance of Ganymede behind the dark limb of
Jupiter with five filters of the ACS/HRC camera. Two exposures in each filter
can be taken during such an event. The images will provide the spectral
variation of the altitude of the apparent limb of Jupiter. The altitude of the
apparent limb is dependent on the presence of hazes in Jupiter's stratosphere.
Hazes of vertical optical depths below 0.001 could be detected with these
observations, providing an extremely sensitive probe of high hazes. The
observations probe altitudes levels near the 1-mb pressure level, for which we
have very limited data. The creation of aerosols, their growth, and their
transport by winds is currently a mostly theoretical study. It would
significantly benefit from constraints derived from the proposed observations.
ACS/HRC is the only instrument capable of the required spatial resolution in
the ultraviolet. Furthermore, a favorable geometry of Ganymede's orbit occurs
only once every six years. This proposal achieves unique results with a

We propose to obtain long-slit optical spectra of three nearby quasars with
the largest reported narrow-line regions {NLRs}. These sources have been shown
to be the cornerstone of a most interesting size--luminosity relationship in
AGN-NLRs which, we suspect, is very problematic. A two-orbit HST/STIS
observation, per source, will allow us to measure several narrow emission
lines from H_beta through H_alpha and [S II] at several distances along the
spatial direction. We will thus be able to classify the line excitation
mechanism, estimate the gas density as a function of distance from the center,
and more properly define the 'NLR size'. This will allow us to test the idea
that the NLR conditions in these quasars are very different from those
observed in low luminosity AGN and, specifically, that some of the narrow
emission lines have a star forming origin. Together with our IR spectra of
high-redshift quasars, we will be able to test the newly discovered NLR
size-luminosity relationship in AGN and the AGN-starburst connection at the
high luminosity end.

Title:	    Towards a global understanding of accretion physics - Clues from
	    an UV spectroscopic survey of Cataclysmic Variables
PI:         Boris Gaensicke

Accretion inflows and outflows are fundamental phenomena in a wide variety of
astrophysical environments, such as Young Stellar Objects, galactic binaries,
and AGN. Observationally, cataclysmic variables {CVs}, interacting white
dwarf/main sequence binaries, are particularly well suited for the study of
accretion processes. Furthermore, CVs that are born with a donor more massive
than the white dwarf are potential progenitors of supernovae type Ia. We are
currently carrying out a STIS UV spectroscopic snapshot survey of CVs to fully
exploit the diagnostic potential of these objects for our understanding of
accretion physics. We analyze the STIS spectra with state-of-the-art accretion
disc model spectra {SYNSPEC}, testing our current knowledge of accretion disk
structure, and thereby, providing new insight into the currently poorly
understood process of viscous dissipation. In addition, we use our
parameterised wind model PYTHON for the analysis of the radiation driven
accretion disc wind spectra, assessing the fundamental question whether the
mass loss rate correlates with the disc luminosity. Our survey data also
identify a number of systems in which the white dwarf significantly
contributes to the UV flux, permitting an analysis of the impact of mass
accretion on the evolution of these compact stars. Finally, anomalous N/C
emission line flux ratios unmistakably identify CVs that started out with a
donor more massive than the white dwarf but failed to reach the Chandrasekhar
limit. Determining the number of these "failed SNIa" will provide crucial
input for the population models of this type of system, and, consequently,
improve the predictions on the number of white dwarf binaries that actually do
overcome the Chandrasekhar limit. While the data obtained so far are of
excellent quality, the number of targets that have been observed so far is too
small for a statistically significant analysis. We propose here to extend this
survey into Cycle 13, building a homogenous database of accretion disc and
wind outflow spectra covering a wide range of mass transfer rates and binary
inclinations, and sampling the N/C abundances of at least 100 CVs.

PI:         James Rhoads

We propose deep images of a recently discovered galaxy at z=6.535, which is
among the most luminous Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies known at high redshift.
The brightness and rarity of this source imply that it is associated with a
high peak in the matter density distribution. {It is the brightest Lyman alpha
source in 2e5 comoving Mpc3, with a luminosity of 6 L*.} Further objects in
this peak are expected to be visible with HST's sensitivity. The Lyman alpha
line has a large rest frame equivalent width, with a lower bound >100
Angstroms. Such a large equivalent width would be impossible for objects
embedded in neutral gas, and instead requires either that {a} the universe was
reionized before z=6.5 or {b} the galaxy resides in a local ionized bubble, in
which case an additional contribution to the ionizing photon budget from
presently undetected neighbors is required. With 19 orbits of ACS and NICMOS
imaging, we will measure this object's morphology and spectral energy
distribution, thus searching for either active nuclei or old stellar
populations. We will also search for possible neighbors, which could establish
the first known galaxy group at z>6, and may provide sufficient ionizing flux
to allow the escape of the observed Lyman alpha photons in a neutral universe.
If neighbors are not found, it will lead to an upper bound on the neutral
fraction in the general IGM at z=6.5.

We have obtained deep very Js, H, Ks imaging with the VLT of two fields with
excellent optical imaging, in order to study high redshift galaxies. Using
these Near-IR images, we identified a class of galaxies with Js - Ks color
larger than 2.3. Photometric redshifts and spectroscopic follow-up showed that
their mean redshift is 2.5 +- 0.7. These galaxies are complementary to Lyman
break selected galaxies: the overlap is minimal, and the rest-frame optical
colors of the Js-Ks selected galaxies are much redder. Their contribution to
the stellar mass density is comparable to that of Lyman breaks in our fields.
SED fits and Near-IR spectroscopy of the Js-Ks selected galaxies indicate
median ages between 1 and 2 Gyr, a factor of 3-5 older than the ages of Lyman
break galaxies estimated by similar methods. They are likely the oldest
galaxies at z=2.5, and may be evolving into the most massive galaxies at z=0.
We propose to obtain images of the spectroscopically confirmed Js-Ks galaxies
with the NICMOS/NIC3 camera in the H band. These galaxies lie the field of
MS1054-03, for which we have excellent groundbased and HST optical imaging.
The increased depth and spatial resolution of the NICMOS imaging will allow us
to determine the restframe optical morphologies of the Js - Ks galaxies, in
order to study their intensity profiles and regularity, to decompose the
largest galaxies in bulges and disks, to measure scale lengths, and to look
for evidence of merging and recent star formation. This study would provide us
unique insight into the nature of these red galaxies, their evolutionary

Little is currently known concerning the mass-luminosity relation {MLR} of
Population II stars. In Cycle 10, we began an initial study with FGS1 to
resolve a sample of known spectroscopic binaries preselected as high-velocity
and/or low metallicity objects. This has resulted in significant new
information about the astrophysical parameters of metal-poor stars, but was
limited mainly to intermediate metallicities, not to true Population II stars.
A new sample of metal-poor spectroscopic binaries identified by Latham and his
collaborators {e.g. Latham et al 2002} contains three new very metal-poor
objects resolvable with FGS. We propose to observe these binaries and obtain
additional observations of two very important resolved targets from our
initial sample. As with that program, we will couple the already-known
spectroscopic orbits with astrometric information which only FGS can deliver
at present. To ensure that the most will be gained from these data, we als o
request observations of three metal-poor single stars to be used as
calibration objects. In combination with results from our previous program,
these observations can be expected to resolve the question of the location of
the Population II main sequence and give valuable insight into the accuracy of
isochrone fitting for determination of globular clusters ages. Due to the
combination of target magnitudes and expected separations, no object in this

PI:         Przemyslaw Wozniak

The observed optical depths to microlensing of stars in the Galactic bulge are
difficult to reconcile with our present understanding of Galactic dynamics.
The main source of uncertainty in those comparisons is now shifting from
microlensing measurements to the dynamical models of the Galactic bar. We
propose to constrain the Galactic bar models with proper motion observations
of Bulge stars that underwent microlensing by determining both the kinematic
identity of the microlensed sources and the importance of streaming motions.
The lensed stars are typically farther than randomly selected stars.
Therefore, our proper motion determinations for 36 targeted MACHO events will
provide valuable constraints on the dynamics of bulge stars as a function of
distance. The first epoch data for our proposed events is already available in
the HST archive so the project can be completed within a single HST cycle. The
exceptional spatial resolution of HST is essential for completion of the
project. Constraints on the total mass in the bulge will ultimately lead to
the determination of the amount of dark matter in inner Galaxy.

which HST imaging shows to be single objects are interesting because they
potentially harbor the most massive black holes, and because their existence
places strong constraints on galaxy formation models. When combined with
ground based data already in hand, the objects which HST imaging shows are
superpositions provide valuable information about interaction rates of
early-type galaxies as well as their dust content. They also constrain the

We propose five orbits of ACS Wide Field Camera observations {three orbits
with F814W, one with F606W, and one with F435W} to investigate the unique,
high velocity merging cluster 1E0657-56{z=0.296}. Coupling the ACS images with
deep Chandra observations and ground-based imaging will allow us to compare
maps of the intracluster medium, the dark matter, and the galaxies from which
we can directly estimate the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter,
the dominant mass component in clusters and the Universe. These observations,
combined with hydrodynamic simulations, will either rule out the range of
cross-sections proposed to alleviate problems with collisionless dark matter
or unambiguously detect and measure the self-interaction cross-section. A
secondary objective is to quantify the impact of a supersonic merger on star
formation and the morphological evolution of cluster galaxies. The geometry of
1E0657-56 {with the merger nearly in the plane of the sky} coupled with the
subcluster velocity {4500 km/s} accurately constrains the timescale of the
merger. In particular since the subcluster traversed the dense core of the

Title:	    The Origin of Dwarf Galaxies and Steep Luminosity Functions in
	    Clusters
PI:         Christopher Conselice

Clusters of galaxies contain an overdensity of dwarfs compared to the field.
The origin of these dwarfs is unknown, but a large fraction of them did not
form through standard collapses early in the universe. Some dwarf ellipticals
in clusters have metal rich and young stellar populations while others contain
old metal poor populations, suggesting multiple formation mechanisms and time
scales. We propose to test the idea that dwarfs descend from galaxies accreted
into clusters during the past 8 Gyrs by correlating ages and metallicities of
dwarfs with their internal structures - spiral arms, bars, and disks. If
dwarfs originate from more massive galaxies then these features should be
common in metal rich and young dwarfs. On the other hand, if no correlation is
found it would suggest that dwarfs form through in-situ collapses of gas in
the intragalactic medium after the universe was reionized.

Title:	    Resolving OB Binaries in the Carina Nebula, Resuming the Survey
PI:         Edmund Nelan

In March 2002 we carried out a small, high-angular resolution survey of some
of the brightest OB stars in the Carina Nebula with FGS1r in an attempt to
resolve binary systems which had thus far evaded detection by other
techniques. Of 23 stars observed, 5 new OB binaries were discovered with
component separations ranging from 0.015" to0.325". This yield over the
spatial domain of FGS1r's angular resolution, coupled with published
statistics of the incidence of OB stars in short-period spectroscopic, and
long-period visual binaries suggests that the fraction of binarity or
multiplicity among OB stars is near unity. Our unexpected resolution of the
prototype O2 If* star HD 93129A as a 55 milli-arcsecond double is a case in
point that great care must be excerised when one attemps to establish the IMF
and upper-mass cuttoff at the high-mass end of the HR diagram. We propose to
resume the survey to observe a larger, statistically meaningful sample of OB
stars to establish a firm assessment of multiplicity at the high-mass end of
the IMF in these clusters. We will also investigate the
single-star/binary-star status of several astrophysically important,
individual stars in order to enable a better understanding of the evolution of
high-mass stars.

Title:	    The Deep Lamp Project
PI:         Thomas Ayres

Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph is the most sophisticated space-borne
spectrometer ever built, probably the last of its kind for some time to come.
A key virtue of STIS is that its medium- and high-resolution echelle modes
provide access to broad intervals of the vacuum ultraviolet spectrum in a
single shot. Another virtue is the validation of the wavelength scales by
periodic observations of an onboard hollow-cathode emission line source. Tying
together the different echelle orders by means of the accurately known lamp
spectrum enables a wide range of studies that exploit differential comparisons
of velocity diagnostics in stellar, interstellar, and even extragalactic
spectra. Despite the importance of the wavelength calibrations, however, they
are done only infrequently {once a year}. While STIS undoubtedly must be one
of the most stable orbiting spectrographs ever designed, possible thermal
distortions of the instrument might cause small nonlinear deviations of the
wavelength scales and thereby impact the velocity precision. The existing
wavecal data sets are separated too far apart in time to isolate short-term
thermal fluctuations from long-term secular behavior, and the routine
WAVELINEs taken with every grating switch are too underexposed to reveal any
differential behavior across the spectrum, aside from a simple zero-point
offset. I therefore propose to obtain a series of deep lamp exposures in a few
representative modes of the NUV and FUV MAMAs to search for and characterize
short-term differential distortions of the echelle formats. This work also
will provide an important dataset to test new approaches to derive the basic
dispersion relations, such as the effort underway by the Physical Modeling
Group at ESA's ST-ECF. The calibration campaign can be scheduled in pure
parallel mode with no loss of orbits from the Cycle 13 science program.

Title:	    Evolution of Light Echoes of SN 1993J
PI:         Ben Sugerman

SN 1993J is the nearest SN in the last decade, and only one of seven objects
to produce confirmed light echoes. Our analyses of archival HST/WFPC2 datareve
aled that the SN has illuminated at least two light-echo structures in the
galaxy M81. Those echoes appear to define two sheets of dust, located roughly
260 ly and 770 ly in front of the SN, which are the first, and most efficient,
3-D probes of the ISM in M81. The echoes not only reveal the ISM's structure,
but also constrain the density, composition and grain-size of its dust. Echoes
are transient events, and as they change on timescales shorter than a year,
continued monitoring will reveal new illuminated material, tracing
interstellar and circumstellar structure. We propose a modest and highly
efficient campaign by HST to image these and yet undiscovered echoes toward SN
1993J. Such observations will build the first direct 3-D map of the ISM within
a million cubic parsecs of M81's spiral arm, and may glimpse the circumstellar
environment affected by the projenitor's mass loss. Such results probe the
nature of extragalactic dust, reveal spatio-kinematic information about the
M81's disk, tightly constrain its internal extinction, and under the proper
circumstances, provide an independent distance measurement to the host galaxy.

Title:	    Critical STIS Spectroscopy and ACS Imagery at the Top of the IMF
PI:         Nolan Walborn

We shall observe two key massive hot stars to investigate the effects of
multiplicity and rotational mixing on their parameters and evolution. {1} The
prototype O2 If* star HD 93129A dominates the compact cluster Trumpler 14, one
of the ionizing clusters of the Carina Nebula. It has been an anchor point for
analyses of the most massive stars. Unexpectedly, it has been resolved as a 55
mas binary by FGS. The derived delta m of 0.9 implies that the companion may
be similar to the O3 dwarfs HD 93128 and HD 93129B {3" from A} in Tr 14.
Recent radio and X-ray data suggest that the HD 93129A system is a
colliding-wind binary. We propose to resolve the system spectroscopically with
STIS in both the optical and FUV. Also, we plan an orbit of very short ACS
exposures on this key cluster to obtain resolved multicolor photometry of its
crowded inner members for the first time. {2} The recent discovery of a CNO
dichotomy among five O2 giants in the Magellanic Clouds provides a new
evolutionary diagnostic for the most massive stars, which is related to their
initial rotational velocities. The abundance anomalies are seen in the UV wind
spectra as well as optical lines. We propose to observe the FUV spectrum of
the LMC ON2 star LH10-3061 with STIS to support further analysis, since it is
the only one of these stars lacking UV data.

Title:	    What drives the outflows in powerful radio galaxies?
PI:         Clive Tadhunter

There is increasing speculation that activity-induced outflows are an
important feedback mechanism in evolution of galaxy bulges, yet uncertainties
remain about the nature, dominant driving mechanism and powers of the
outflows. In order to address these issues, we propose to make deep ACS and
STIS observations of two compact radio sources in which we recently found
unequivocal evidence for powerful emission line outflows, and in which all the
potential drivers for the outflows -- quasar nuclei, relativistic jets and
starbursts -- are known to be present. Using the unique capabilities of
HST/ACS we will map the outflow regions in these sources at high spatial
resolution and thereby determine the dominant outflow driving mechanism. In
addition, by combining the morphological information from the ACS data with
information on the kinematics and physical conditions derived from STIS and
ground-based spectra, we will determine the mass outflow rates and powers in
the outflows. This will be the first comprehensive study of the near-nuclear
outflows in radio galaxies. Such studies are crucial for determining whether
the activity associated with powerful extragalactic radio sources has a major
impact on the evolution of the host early-type galaxies.

Title:	    Star Formation in Damped Lya Galaxies: Testing the Connection with

PI:         Jason Prochaska

The principal challenge of damped Lya {DLA} research is to identify and study
the stellar components of these galaxies. Although two decades of
absorption-line research has yielded the HI gas content, metallicity, velocity
fields, molecular and dust content of these galaxies only a handful have been
studied in emission. Therefore, it has been very difficult to compare the DLA
galaxies with the successful surveys of high z galaxies discovered in emission
{e.g. Lyman break galaxies; LBG}. This is particulary important given that DLA
systems are the probable precursors to galaxies like the Milky Way. Because
the DLA systems are identified toward bright background quasars, deep
observations at high spatial resolution with astable PSF are essential and
only HST provides the observing capability. Recently, two major advances have
greatly enhanced the prospects for measuring emission from DLA host galaxies:
{1} we have developed a new spectroscopic technique for inferring the star
formation rates {SFR} of the DLA which enables one to pre-select the brightest
candidates; {2} the high spatial resolution and sensitivity of the ACS
represents a major improvement over previous capabilities. We will obtain deep
V-band images with the ACS of 5 high z DLA with the highest inferred apparent
optical magnitudes. The complete survey will offer a robust satistical
analysis of: {a} the extent and morphology of the DLA star forming regions;
{b} the likelihood that the DLA and LBG correspond to the same population of
protogalaxies; {c} a test of the protogalactic clump models favored by CDM
cosmology. We emphasize this program will offer a major advance over all
previous studies. Finally, we will complement these HST observations with an
extensive observing campaign {IFU spectroscopy and deep IR imaging} on the
Keck, VLT, and Magellan telescopes to provide the most extensive dataset yet

mass companions with masses down to 6 Jupiter masses, and at separations
larger than 3 A.U. are bright enough for a direct detection with HST/NICMOS
using the spectral differential imaging technique in two narrow-band filters

PI:         Thomas Rauch

We propose UV spectroscopy of the four unique post-AGB stars of spectral type
O{He} in order to understand the origin of their peculiar surface abundances.
These stars are the only known amongst the hottest post-AGB stars {effective
temperatures > 100, 000 K} whose atmospheres are composed of almost pure
helium. This chemistry markedly differs from that of the hydrogen-deficient
post-AGB evolutionary sequence with objects which have carbon dominated
atmospheres {PG1159 stars and Wolf-Rayet central stars}. While PG1159 and
Wolf-Rayet stars are the result of a late helium-shell flash, this scenario
cannot explain the O{He} stars. Instead, they are possibly double-degenerate
mergers. We speculate that the four O{He} stars represent evolved RCrB stars,
which also have helium dominated atmospheres. We aim to determine the C, N, O,
and Si abundances precisely, in order to proof this evolutionary link.

Title:	    Groups of Dwarf Galaxies: Pools of Mostly Dark Matter?
PI:         R. Tully

Within 5 Mpc, there are 6 groups with well-known luminous galaxies but there
also appears to be a comparable number of groups containing only dwarfs. If
these dwarf entities are truly bound then M/L values are an order of magnitude
higher than values found for groups with luminous spiral galaxies. There are
theoretical reasons to anticipate that low mass halos may frequently be mostly
dark. The dynamical influence of low mass halos is negligible in familiar
groups with luminous members. By contrast, a study of the dynamics of `groups
of dwarfs' may provide direct evidence of the existence of dark matter
potential wells with few baryons. The goal of the present study is to gather
detailed information on the 3-D distribution of dwarf galaxies suspected to
lie within 7 groups of dwarfs within 5 Mpc. Distances with 7% relative
accuracy can be measured with the Tip of the Giant Branch method with ACS and
integrations within 1 orbit per target.

PI:         Smita Mathur

The main reservoir of low redshift baryons is still ``missing'': All the
observed stellar and gaseous components add up to a factor of ten below the
abundance predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis. Hydrodynamic cosmological
simulations predict that a large fraction of the low redshift baryons should
reside in a warm/hot diffuse intergalactic medium {IGM}, detectable via an
``X-ray forest'' of high excitation metal lines, but blind searches of X-ray
lines are extraordinarily difficult with present technology. A first hint of
this warm-hot IGM may have been found in recent studies of OVI absorption
towards background quasars. However, the significance of OVI absorbers to the
total baryon budget is uncertain and UV observations alone cannot determine
the physical conditions in the IGM. We propose STIS/E140M observations to
search for intervening OVI absorbers towards two quasars that are bright
enough in X-rays for follow-up Chandra spectroscopy. The combined UV/X-ray
study provides a powerful tool to {1} assess the cosmological significance of
OVI absorbers; {2} determine their physical properties using OVII/OVI and
OVIII/OVI ratios; and {3} pursue detection and study of the warm-hot IGM.

Title:	    A Critical Test for Radiatively Driven Hot Winds in Cool Stars
PI:         Alex Lobel

We propose STIS observations of the C IV resonance emission line profiles for
the two brightest short-period classical Cepheid variables Delta Cep and Beta
Dor, to critically test if P Cygni-type profiles form in the hot transition
region plasmas of their pulsating upper atmospheres. Recent FUSE observations
of the cool {non-variable} G-supergiant Alpha Aqr {and Beta Aqr} show a
distinct P Cygni-type profile in warm transition region emission lines of C
III. The observations reveal supersonic wind outflow velocities that exceed
~140 km/s, based on our semi-empiric radiative transfer models. The models
demonstrate that optically thick supersonic winds occur in the outer
atmospheres of cool giant and supergiant stars, at kinetic gas temperatures
well above 80 kK. STIS observations of cool regular pulsating Cepheid
variables will confirm or reject our present hypothesis that these peculiar P
Cygni-type line shapes form in a supersonic accelerating wind structure that
is {partly} driven by a radiative atmospheric acceleration mechanism,
generally adopted for driving the much faster winds of hot luminous stars.
STIS observations of the detailed line shapes of hot transition region
emission lines in Cepheids can establish an important physical link between
the radiation-driven wind theory of hot stars, and the acoustic/magnetic
wave-driven wind theory of cool stars. The proposed high-resolution far-UV
spectra of these important pulsating cool stars will be an invaluable
contribution to the HST Archive.

Aim of this proposal is to perform high-resolution imaging of the proposed
optical counterparts of the two, radio silent, isolated neutron stars
RXJ1308.6+2127 and RX J1605.3+3249 with the STIS/50CCD. Imaging both fields
with the same instrumental configuration used in mid 2001 by Kaplan et al
{2002; 2003}, will allow us to measure the objects' position and to determine
their proper motions over a time base of nearly four years. The measurement of
proper motions at the level of at least few tens mas/yr, expected for
relatively nearby neutron stars, would unambigouosly secure the proposed
optical identifications, not achievable otherwise. In addition, the knowledge
of the proper motion will provide useful indications on the space velocity and
distance of these neutrons stars, as well as on the radius. Constraining these
parameters is of paramount importance to discriminate between the variety of
emission mechanisms invoked to explain their observed thermal X-ray spectra
and to probe the neutron star equation of state {EOS}. The determination of
the proper motion is a decisive step toward a dedicated follow-up program
aimed at measuring the objects' optical parallax, thus providing much firmer
constrains on the star properties, again to be performed with the STIS/50CCD.

one of the two ULXs is in a peculiar star-forming complex: we have suggested
that it is an expanding wave of star-formation triggered by a dwarf galaxy
plunging through the outer disk of NGC 4559. The ACS observation will also

We propose a near-UV {3000-5500AA} long-slit spectroscopic study of a sample

from our Cycle 11 ACS near-UV snapshot survey. This survey collected HST
U-band images for 78 galaxies, which also have optical and near-IR images
available in the archive. We propose to enrich this image database with STIS

availability of the near-UV images which will allow us to select the best slit
centering and orientation to probe the circumnuclear structures. Our goal is
to investigate the nature of these structures, characterizing the
circumnuclear continuum and ionizing source of these galaxies at a spatial
resolution of $sim$10 parsecs, where we will probe the black hole environment.
With the proposed observations, we will derive properties of the circumnuclear
stellar populations of the selected galaxies {ages, masses and metallicities},
evolutionary effects connecting the growth of the black hole with the growth
of the galaxy bulge, as well as the relation between the black hole mass,
accretion rate {luminosity} and the circumnuclear stellar population
properties. This dataset will also allow us to study the effect of the bulge

The masses of the giant black holes in galaxies are correlated with the
luminosities, masses, and velocity dispersions of their host spheroids. This
empirical connection of phenomena on widely different scales {from sub-parsec
to kiloparsec} suggests that the evolution of a galaxy and its central black
hole are closely linked. We propose to test various unified formation models,
by measuring the cosmic evolution of the black hole/spheroid relations, back
to z=0.37 {a lookback time of 4 Gyrs}. We will obtain 1-orbit ACS images of a
sample of 20 Seyfert 1 galaxies, for which we already have extensive new
ground-based measures of the black hole masses and the stellar velocity
dispersions. HST resolution is required for accurate measurement of the
nonstellar AGN continuum, and the luminosity and effective radius of the bulge
of each host galaxy. This will complete the set of observables needed to map
the co-evolution of spheroids and black-holes. The proposed sample is the
minimum required to make the first measure of the black hole mass/bulge

around another lighter white dwarf. VLT optical spectra showed faint and broad
{1500km/s FWHM} HeII {mainly} emission lines, even though the presence of H
can not be completely ruled out due to spectral resolution. Moreover, recent
XMM observations with the OM confirmed that the broad band energy spectrum of
this source peaks in the UV band, making it one of the best target for HST
studies. Here we propose to use the STIS spectroscopic capability of HST in
the TIME-TAG mode. The latter mode is extremely well suited for our purposes,
since will allow us, among other things, to perform, for the first time, an
Orbital Phase Spectroscopy of the expected He lines {also those of C, N and O
are expected} in the STIS spectra. We expect to finally probe the nature of
the source by following the emission line centroid shift as a function of the

Young stars with circumstellar material are common, but their properties vary
greatly. Current studies strongly suggest that Beta Pictoris {A5 V} is an
early solar system. If the high-density, high-velocity circumstellar gas
falling toward Beta Pic were fueled by grazing comets or on-going erosion of
debris located close to the star, we would expect to find evidence for warm
dust in all Beta Pic-like systems. We have carried out detailed studies of the
circumstellar environments of all nearby A-type stars. We have studied not
only their circumstellar dust but also the characteristics of their
circumstellar gas through absorption line spectroscopy. Based on our visible
and IUE data, we identified about a dozen A-type stars with circumstellar gas.
Among them, 7 have dynamic circumstellar gas similar to that found in the Beta
Pic system, but none of them has detectable IRAS infrared excess. What is the
origin of the dynamic circumstellar gas around young A-type stars? The STIS
wavelength range covers many fine-structure lines that can only be seen at
high densities, which are characteristic of circumstellar but not interstellar
gas. We propose to observe these 7 stars with STIS to {a} verify the
circumstellar gas detections from our previous visible and IUE studies, {b}
determine the temperature and electron number density in the circumstellar
gas, {c} derive accurate circumstellar gas column densities, and {d} study the

Title:	    Probing the Nucleosynthesis Products of the First Stars
PI:         Christopher Sneden

We propose the first extensive HST study of Galactic halo stars that are
deficient in heavy {i.e., neutron-capture} elements. These so-called r-
process-poor stars contain the nucleosynthesis products from the earliest
generations of stars, the progenitors of the halo stars. Detections of the
lightest neutron-capture elements, such as Ge, along with some of the
heaviest, including Pt, can only be obtained in the NUV. Our HST abundance
analysis of the well-known bright {r-process-poor} giant star HD 122563
indicates a surprising drop off in neutron-capture element abundances from Ge
to Pt. This is in contrast to the solar pattern seen in r-process-rich stars,
and suggests that some of the very earliest generations of stars were unable
to synthesize the heaviest elements. To confirm and strengthen this finding we
will obtain abundance determinations for a number of neutron-capture elements
in a target sample of 8 stars, spanning a wide range of metallicity. The
resulting abundance distributions will provide a direct indication of the
nucleosynthetic conditions {such as temperatures, densities, and neutron
fluxes} in the halo progenitors. These in turn will help to identify the
characteristics {such as masses and metallicities} and nature of the first
stars in the Galaxy.

Title:	    Uncovering the unknown Ly-alpha flux in classical T Tauri stars
PI:         Gregory Herczeg

The FUV emission of CTTSs significantly impacts the chemical evolution and
aids in the dispersal of gas in protoplanetary disks. Despite its importance,
the dominant source of FUV emission, H I Ly-alpha at 1215.67 A, is not
directly observable due to neutral hydrogen absorption in our line of sight to
nearly all young stars. We have recently developed a novel technique to
indirectly measure the Ly-alpha emission incident on the disk using Ly-alpha
pumped molecular hydrogen emission lines, which are detected throughout the UV
spectra of CTTSs. Measuring the Ly-alpha flux has a large effect of the total
FUV emission from CTTSs: results from test cases demonstrate that at least 75%
of the FUV emission is in this one line. The lack of accurate measurements of
Ly-alpha remains a glaring weakness in chemical models of protoplanetary disks
and disk dispersal. This strong emission will create a Ly-alpha dominated
PDR-like disk surface at planet-forming radii close to the star. We propose
using molecular hydrogen emission to reconstruct the intrinsic Ly-alpha line
from three CTTSs to understand the dominant FUV emission source from these
stars and its effect on protoplanetary disks.

Title:	    The Next Generation Spectral Library
PI:         David Silva

We propose to complete our snapshot program to produce a Next Generation
Spectral Library of 600 stars for use in modeling the integrated light of
galaxies and clusters. This program is using the low dispersion UV and optical
gratings of STIS. The library will be roughly equally divided among four
metallicities, very low {[Fe/H] < -1.5}, low {-1.5 < [Fe/H] < -0.5},
near-solar {-0.3 < [Fe/H] < 0.1}, and super-solar {[Fe/H] > 0.2},
well-sampling the entire HR-diagram in each bin. Such a library will surpass
all extant compilations and have lasting archival value, well into the Next
Generation Space Telescope era. Because of the universal utility and
community-broad nature of this venture, we waive the entire proprietary
period.

Title:	    Probing a damped Lyman-alpha system along two lines of sight
PI:         Nicholas Morgan

Damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems hold key information about galaxy
formation and chemical evolution of the Universe. We have recently discovered
that the bright {V = 15.5} z=1.07 quasar HS 2209+1914 is a gravitationally
lensed double with an image separation of 1.0 arcsec and a clearly detected
lensing galaxy. A strong Mg II and Fe II absorption systems at z=0.51 is very
suggestive of a common damped Ly-alpha absorber {DLA} in both lines of sight,
presumably identical with the lensing galaxy. We propose to obtain UV
spectroscopy of both QSO components, with the principal aim to confirm the DLA
hypothesis and obtain the column density of neutral hydrogen along both lines
of sight. This will enable future high-resolution spectroscopy to determine
elemental abundances and their spatial variance between different locations in
the absorber. In combination with new ground-based deep infrared images, HS
2209+1914 will be the only known DLA galaxy where spatially resolved abundance
information can be directly related to the observed distribution of stellar
light. Byproducts of our study will include new insights into the lensing
geometry of the system, a high S/N measurement of differential extinction
through the lensing galaxy, and an estimate of the lensing galaxy's extinction
curve.

Title:	    Spatially Resolved mid-UV Spectra of the Centers of Local Group

PI:         Ricardo Schiavon

We propose to use STIS to collect medium resolution mid-UV and optical spectra
from the nuclei of M31, M32 and NGC 205. The observations will provide
fundamental constraints to the stellar population models we are currently
developing in our Treasury Program {GO-9455, PI Ruth Peterson}. The data will
also be useful to constrain the stellar population content in the centers of
the target galaxies. Last but not least, they will be crucial templates for
studies of distant galaxies, by providing a direct assessment of
spectrophotometric evolution in the mid-UV.

Title:	    Abundances in AGN Outflows: Putting Real Numbers Into Quasar
	    Feedback Scenarios
PI:         Nahum Arav

AGN outflows impact the evolution of supermassive black holes, host galaxies,
and the surrounding IGM. To assess the importance of these processes, it is
essential to obtain the physical properties of real AGN winds. Our proposed
HST/STIS observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 509, in combination with
dedicated FUSE time, are designed to obtain the first reliable determination
of chemical abundances for an AGN outflow. Previous attempts to measure
abundances from outflow absorption troughs did not account for velocity
dependent covering factors of the absorbers. This led to large uncertainties
in measuring absorption column densities, uncertainties which are magnified
when translated to abundances. To extract reliable column densities, we
created an array of analysis tools for modeling high-S/N echelle data of
doublets and higher multiplet lines from the same ion. After carefully
reviewing all the available targets we conclude that the combination of high
UV flux and unblended outflow troughs makes Mrk 509 the most promising target
for obtaining abundances in AGN outflows. Our proposed Mrk 509 observations
will provide the best input to date for accurately modeling the influence of
AGN winds on the galactic and inter-galactic environments.

will substantially increase the number of line-emitting galaxies detected. As
our previous work has demonstrated, the most frequently detected line is
