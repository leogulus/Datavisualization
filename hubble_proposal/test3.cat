Title:	    Locating Ultraluminous X-Ray Sources
PI:         Philip Kaaret

We propose to observe ultraluminous X-ray sources which are located near
objects bright both in the X-rays and the optical using Chandra and HST. The
presence of these reference objects will allow us to tie the x-ray and optical
references frames and achieve 0.1-0.2 arcsecond relative position accuracy in
searching for optical counterparts to the ultraluminous x-ray sources. This
will be a significant improvement over the accuracy previously obtained for
most ULXs {limited by Chandra's absolute astrometry} and will should permit
identification of individual counterparts.

PI:         Eric Perlman

We propose deep followup HST and Chandra observations of two X-ray jets, which
are the X-ray brightest discovered in our Chandra survey of quasars with known
radio jets. With these data, we will compare their X-ray, optical and radio
morphologies. We will also obtain X-ray and optical spectral indices, and
spatially resolved SEDs from the radio through the X-rays. This will allow us
to determine the X-ray emission mechanism at each point in these jets, and
test critical predictions made by each mechanism. We will also be able to
track any changes in physical conditions {including magnetic field and bulk
Lorentz factor} that are present in the observed 90 degree bends.

PI:         Craig Sarazin

We propose 4 new Chandra observations of NGC4697, the nearest X-ray-faint,
optically-bright elliptical, which was resolved into low mass X-ray binaries
{LMXBs} in Cycle 1. We will detect LMXBs at least three times fainter {~1e37
ergs/s} than possible for any luminous E galaxy at present, allowing a direct
comparison with the LMXBs in our Galaxy and M31. We will measure the
variability of sources on times up to 4.5 yr. Models predict variability for
LMXBs in early-type galaxies, which is particularly strong for the brightest
black hole sources. We also propose 1 orbit of HST to detect >1500 globular
clusters {GCs}. If the results for luminous LMXBs continue to low LX, most of
the LMXBs will be identified with GCs. We will study the formation history of
LMXBs, GCs, and field stars in N4697.

Title:	    The Physics of Relativistic Jets: Chandra Imaging of Extended Jets
	    in Gamma-loud Blazars
PI:         F. Tavecchio

Extended jets have been a key target for Chandra yet only recently has the
kpc-scale jet physics been compared to that of the inner, parsec-scale jets.
Such a comparison reveals the jet deceleration, power dissipation, pressure
gradient, and confinement mechanism --- all essential ingredients for
understanding the relativistic jets that characterize radio- loud AGN.
Currently, few data exist to make this comparison. We propose to double the
sample, with Chandra observations of 4 gamma-loud blazars: 0954+556 and
1229-021, the only 2 bright radio jets not yet observed by Chandra; and
0208-512 and 3C 454.3, observed in A03 with much too short exposures. We also
propose HST multi-band ACS imaging of jet knots in 0208-512, 0954+556 and 3C
454.3.

PI:         Walter Lewin

We propose to extend our ongoing studies of the dynamical evolution of
globular clusters by observing their populations of low-luminosity X-ray
sources. Many of these sources are binary systems {or have evolved from them}
and hold the key to the clusters with widely different physical properties
such as central concentration, cluster size and mass, which are all key
ingredients in the formation and evolution of binaries. To make this study as
uniform as possible, the clusters will be observed to the same limiting
luminosity. Numberical simulations with the world's fastest computer will
assist in the interpretation of our observational data.

PI:         Michael Garcia

During A01-3 we found 22 Black Hole X-ray Novae {BHXN} in M31 using Chandra,
and with HST {WFPC2} found two optical counterparts. Our results suggest
either a surprisingly high ratio of BH to NS binaries, or a surprisingly high
duty cycle for BHXN. We propose to continue this program, with the goals of
understanding the relative number of BH vs. NS X-ray binaries in the M31
bulge, and determining the orbital period distribution and duty cycles of
these BHXN. Continued observations can determine the duty cycle. The new ACS
will allow us to go 2 mags deeper than the WFPC2, and could triple the number
of optical counterparts and therefore orbital period estimates. M31 is the
only galaxy near enough to allow this extragalactic survey for BHXN.

We propose to obtain the first high-quality, wide-band spectral energy
distribution {SED} of the neutron star X-ray nova Cen X-4 in quiescence. We
will compare this SED to those we have previously obtained for black hole
X-ray novae {BHXRN} in quiescence. Our previous comparisons of SEDs have been
very powerful in revealing the nature of these exotic objects; for example,
they have revealed the best evidence yet for the existence of event horizons.
These wide-band, high quality SEDs have revealed the presence of ADAFs in
BHXN, and are revealing the presence of winds {ADIOS} and/or convection
{CDAFs} in these flows. Previous SEDs of Cen X-4 have suffered from
non-simultaneity and have not included the FUV, where the emission may well
peak.

excellent photometry on the recently identified optical counterpart of
1E1339.8+2837 in the F220W, F250W and F330W bands. Using the ACS/WFC, we will
survey M3's central regions in B, V, and I to identify counterparts to other
Chandra sources, and also obtain excellent B, V, and I photometry of the

be derived. Nine HST orbits are requested to do the optical identifications in
this field down to Mv ~ 9, sufficient to identify most CVs and qLMXBs. This

Title:	    Long Term Monitoring of FGS1r in Position Mode
PI:         Edmund Nelan

It is known from our experience with FGS3, and later with FGS1r, that an FGS
on orbit experiences long term evolution, presumably due to disorption of
water from the instrument's graphite epoxy composits. This manifests principly
as a change in the plate scale and secondarily as a change in the geometric
distortions. These effects are well modeled by adjustments to the rhoA and kA
parameters which are used to transform the star selector servo angles into FGS
{x, y} detector space coordinates. By observing the relative positions of
selected stars in a standard cluster at a fixed telescope pointing and
orientation, the evolution of rhoA and kA can be monitored and calibrated to
preserve the astrometric performance of FGS1r.

Transfer Functions are needed to support the analysis of GO science data for

have been observed in previous cycles to monitor the long term evolution of
the FGS1r S-curves. This proposal also {1} monitors the FGS1r Lateral Color
response {using stars Latcol-A and Latcol-B}, {2} calibrates the "Pos/Trans"
bias of a star's position as determined from Transfer mode and Position mode
observations, and {3} calibrates the shift of a star's centroid when observed
with F5ND relative to that when observed with F583W.

Title:	    Spectrophotometry of FAINT IR STANDARDS
PI:         Ralph Bohlin

Faint spectrophotometric standard stars required for COS and the SBC channel
on ACS have been established via the STIS FASTEX program that has executed
over the last three cycles. Cycle 12 is an especially opportune time to
establish companion faint IR standards for WFC3, because the NICMOS proposal
9998 includes observations in cycle 12 of all 6 of the primary standard stars
in order to establish the absolute flux calibration of the three grism modes
to 1%. In addition to WFC3, these new faint secondary IR standards will be a
significant step towards establishing flux standards for JWST, as well as for
SNAP, SIRTF, and SOFIA. The 6 primary standards included in Propid=9998 are in
the range of V=11-13 and include three hot pure hydrogen WDs and 3 solar
analogs. We propose to establish new IR faint standards in the 15-17 mag
range. Appropriate spectral types for faint IR standards are solar analogs and
hotter WDs. Many M type and cooler stars are variable, so that long term
monitoring is required before committing HST time to such cool stars. A few G
type and WD faint stars will provide a set of faint IR standards with minimal
sky and color coverage. Existing HST images of any candidates can provide
verification that there are no contaminating stars above the 1% level within
2-3arcsec. However, the ACS calibration field in 47 Tuc is too crowded for
linking to ground based observations. If the other candidates are selected
from SDSS or other ground based data, then the NICMOS and STIS acquisition
images can provide this verification, as well as correction factors for
arbitrary photometric size apertures. The SNAP team is providing the northern
faint stars using unreleased SDSS data. In addition, the extreme coolest types
such as L and T stars have proven essential to sorting out the long wavelength
QE of ACS; both the ACS and eventually WFC3 calibrations could be improved
with knowledge of L and T SEDs in the region beyond 0.95 microns. In addition
to the primary purpose of ACS QE vs. wavelength and broad band F814W and
F850LP calibrations, these three stars in C.} below are at the flux level
required for WFC3 grism calibration. The brighter M, L, and T standard stars
will each require a NICMOS orbit, while each faint standard requires two
Nicmos orbits and one STIS orbit for complete wavelength coverage. The STIS
spectra of the M and L stars are done as ACS calibrations in cycles 12 and 11,
respectively. An additional faint WD has already been proposed for 2 Nicmos
and 4 STIS orbits in their cycle 12 programs already. See Table 1 for a
summary of the 18 orbit allocation for this program 10014. Bright stars in the
V=0-6 mag range would be useful for direct comparisons to NIST calibrated
lamps. This comparison would offer the opportunity to compare two
fundamentally different realms of physics: pure hydrogen stellar models and
laboratory black body physics. Unfortunately, the Nicmos bright limit is V=~8
for a solar analog and a 1s exposure without defocussing the OTA. The primary
Sloan standard BD+17d4708 at V=9.9 is safely fainter than this Nicmos limit.

The remaining time in the orbit will be spent extending the wavelength
coverage using G750L. To date, HST has not provided any faint solar analog
stars to compliment the three V=12-13.5 mag solar analogs provided by M. Rieke
for NICMOS calibration. As instrumentation in space and on the ground becomes
more sensitive, fainter flux standards are required. A solar analog in a field
with low reddening is an excellent choice for a fainter standard, because
unreddened pure hydrogen WDs are rare beyond V=16, because Solar absolute
fluxes are well measured at all wavelengths, and because the fluxes do not
fall off as fast as the hot WDs at longer wavelengths. A 16.5 G star may not
be faint enough for most JWST modes but will provide a significant step in the
right direction. The SNAP program requires such a spectrophotometric standard,
which lies at the bright limit of its spectroscopy mode. NICMOS grism
observation of this standard are planned for cycle 12 and STIS spectra are
required to establish the standard over the full range from 0.3-2 microns.

PI:         Bahram Mobasher

This is a follow-up study to proposal 8839 to study STIS CTE calibration for
extended objects. This takes images of galaxies to measure the effects of CTE
on the isophotes of galaxies. The aim is to image small {2-3"} extended
sources in a suitably rich galaxy cluster. The target, A1689, has been
observed by WFPC2 in the WF2 and WF4 chips {in Feb 2000}, so that
cross-instrument comparison will be straightforward. One orbit is needed per

first-order spectra in all L-modes {G191B2B only in the CCD modes due to its

the recently derived CTE formula for STIS Spectroscopic modes with the CCD, by
stepping the target along the slit {7 positions} with two {short} exposure
times. This will verify the results using the two-amplifier readout method,
and provide high-S/N data at low intensity levels and low background level.

Our recent discovery of a planetary-sized body in the inner Oort cloud

determine the size of this object, definitely determine if satellites exist,
and search for the shortest timescale photometric variations. As little is

The charge transfer efficiency {CTE} of the ACS CCD detectors will decline as

be closely monitored at regular intervals, because it is likely to determine
the useful lifetime of the CCDs. All the data for this program is acquired

emulates the ACS pre-flight ground calibration and post-launch SMOV testing

which accurate spectra have been {and will continue to be} measured with STIS.
Two SBC dark current exposures taken as the last exposure of each SBC
sequence. Also, to minimize SBS turn-on/turn-off cycles and in order to check
the lab flats for the SBC detector, internal observations using the deuterium
lamp with F125LP are being taken inflight, following the UV monitor
observations. The internal flats have been taken ~monthly since SMOV, and the
degradation of the lamp has been monitored. The total exposure time to date is
~15 hours giving a total of 8600 counts/pixel. The goal is 10, 000
counts/pixel such that the resulting pipeline flat has uncertainties of ~1%
due to poisson counting statistics. Thus, approximately 3 additional hours of

dithered observations of the cluster. In Cycle 11, this field was observed
again using single pointings at various roll angles. The positions and

as a result of bright object violations which trigger the Bright Scene
Detection or Software Global Monitors. Anomalous shutdowns can also occur as a
result of MAMA hardware problems. The Initial MAMA turn-on/recovery from
anomalous shutdown consists of three tests: a signal processing electronics
check, high voltage ramp-up to an intermediate voltage, and high voltage
ramp-up to the full operating voltage. During each of the two high voltage
ramp-ups, diagnostics are performed during a dark ACCUM. The turn-on is
followed by a MAMA Fold Analysis . The complete sequence is contained in
visits 1 through 4. If a second execution is required during cycle 12, visits

wavelengths {lambda_c} for {a} WFC {inner+outer} Halpha {FR716N, FR782N} and
[OIII] {FR551N, FR601N} ramp filters. {b} WFC middle ramp filters {FR388N,
FR459M, FR505N, FR6546N, FR914M}.{c} HRC middle ramp filters {FR388N, FR459M,
FR505N, FR656N, FR914M}. As a secondary goal, we will get an independent check
of the wavelength calibration which will be provided by the IDT team from the
Cycle 11 program 9671. We request 1.5 CVZ orbits to observe two
well-calibrated standard star fields in 47 Tuc with the primary goal of
deriving WFC and HRC continuum L-flats for three middle {WFC1-MRAMP} filters:
FR656N, FR388N, and FR505N. These filters are selected as they are frequently
used to map the Halpha 6563 A, [OII] 3727A, and [OIII] 5007A lines and they
include the least {FR388N} and most {FR505N} uniform ramps, based on ground
data {ISR ACS 02-01}. These 3 filters should provide a good baseline for
testing our approach and gauging the range of non-uniformity in the continuum
L-flats. For good spatial sampling, the 2 fields are selected with stellar
densities appropriate to WFC and HRC. For good spectral sampling we will step
in the central wavelength in steps of 80 A, with 30s exposure at each lambda_c
providing good S/N for V=15-20 mag stars. We will use 2K subarrays to reduce
the frequency of buffer dumps.

ACS G800L observations of an emission line star {the WC Wolf-Rayet star WR96}

improved coverage of the field variation of the dispersion solution for the

taken at many different positions across the WFC field. By fitting the
emission lines, the field dependence of the wavelength zero point and
dispersion will be measured. The WR star was already used in Cycle 11
calibrations and these observations provide improved spatial coverage to map
the variation of the dispersion with position. The observations of the fainter
planetary nebula provide an independent wavelength calibration for a few
points over the field.

PI:         Anton Koekemoer

This proposal is aimed at providing photometric zeropoint cross-calibration
between the commonly used WFPC2 photometric filter sets and those that will be
used for ACS and WFC3. The proposal consists of observations of a set of
standard stars, including the SDSS primary standard BD+17D4708 {F5} and two
red standard stars, VB8 {an M7-dwarf} and 2M0036+18 {L3.5 dwarf}. For the red
stars, medium and broad-band filters redward of F606W are calibrated, while
for BD+17D4708 an extensive set of 22 medium and broad-band filters is used
{from F185W to F1042M}. The intent is to observe these stars with as many
filters as possible, to eventually allow cross-calibration of archival WFPC2
data with data from ACS, WFC3, SDSS and 2MASS.

Title:	    Geometric distortion of F255W for WFPC2 Cycle 12
PI:         Vera Kozhurina-Platais

The goal of astrometric calibration of the HST WFPC2 is to obtain a coordinate
system free of distortion down to the precision level of 1 mas. That precision
is necessary for future astrometric work {e.g., on proper motions} involving a
combination of the archival WFPC2 and recent ACS images. So far such a
calibration has only been obtained for the wide bandpass F555W filter
{Anderson and King, 2003}. Recently V. Kozhurina-Platais {ISR, 2003-002} has
expanded the analysis of the geometric distortion of WFPC2 as a function of
wavelength for two other broadband filters, {F814W and F300W}, and has also
established the plate scale and skew parameters {non-perpendicularity of X and
Y axes} for these filters. This study points to the importance of astrometric
calibration at wavelengths shorter than ~400 nanometers. This proposal seeks
observations in the FUV filter F255W of the Inner Calibration Field in the
globular cluster omega Cen. It is expected that the amount of distortion in
the F255W filter with respect to the F555W filter will be higher by 5% but
this must be established from observations. A total of four astrometric
calibrations in F255W {proposed here}, and F300W, F555, F814W {already
completed} will allow us to interpolate such a calibration for any other
filter from FUV to near infrared.

Title:	    Is the exoplanet HD209458b's exosphere in a blowoff state ?
PI:         Alfred Vidal-Madjar

Using HST Lyman alpha observations, we have detected an extended tail shaped
upper atmosphere around the extra-solar planet HD209458b. The Cycle 10 STIS
G140M observations revealed an absorption of 15+/-4% of the stellar Lyman
alpha emission line during the planetary transit in front of the star
{Vidal-Madjar, et al. 2003}. This showed that HI evaporation is taking place
within a highly extended upper atmosphere. Very recent studies on the
evaporation mechanism are now indicating that instead of ``Jeans escape'' a
more probable mechanism is complete atmospheric ``blowoff'' as suffered by the
telluric planets in the early solar system. This mecanism could be directly
tested with HST by searching for the escape of species slightly heavier than
HI. It is easy to show that neither oxygen nor carbon would be detected with
HST if only ``Jeans escape'' takes place while both species, under ``blowoff''
conditions, should reach the Roche limit of the planet and escape as hydrogen.
If this is the case an absorption during transit of about 15% should be
observed for both. Twelve orbits with the STIS G140L spectrograph will allow
us to detect the presence of these species during three transits with a better
than 5% accuracy, needed to detect an object of the size of the planetary
Roche lobe. Simultaneously these observations will confirm and give more
precision about the extention of the HI cometary like tail expected to occult
the star well after the end of the visible transit. This proposed
investigation is a unique opportunity to further study hot giant planets upper
atmospheres, reveal the precise evaporation mechanism and give new constraints
on the ``hot Jupiters'' lifetime. This could explain the lack of planets
discovered so far at less than 0.04~AU from their star. We ask for HST
observations under Director Discretionnary time to have access to the coming
transits observable in the early fall of 2003.

Title:	    HST UV Images of Saturn's Aurora Coordinated with Cassini Solar
	    Wind Measurements
PI:         John Clarke

A key measurement goal of the Cassini mission to Saturn is to obtain
simultaneous solar wind and auroral imaging measurements in a campaign
scheduled for Jan. 2004. Cassini will measure the solar wind approaching
Saturn continuously from 9 Jan. - 6 Feb., but not closer to Saturn due to
competing spacecraft orientation constraints. The only system capable of
imaging Saturn's aurora in early 2004 will be HST. In this community DD
proposal we request the minimum HST time needed to support the Cassini mission
during the solar wind campaign with UV images of Saturn's aurora. Saturn's
magnetosphere is intermediate between the "closed" Jovian case with large
internal sources of plasma and the Earth's magnetosphere which is open to
solar wind interactions. Saturn's aurora has been shown to exhibit large
temporal variations in brightness and morphology from Voyager and HST
observations. Changes of auroral emitted power exceeding one order of
magnitude, dawn brightenings, and latitudinal motions of the main oval have
all been observed. Lacking knowledge of solar wind conditions near Saturn, it
has not been possible to determine its role in Saturn's auroral processes, nor
the mechanisms controlling the auroral precipitation. During Cassini's
upcoming approach to Saturn there will be a unique opportunity to answer these
questions. We propose to image one complete rotation of Saturn to determine
the corotational and longitudinal dependences of the auroral activity. We will
then image the active sector of Saturn once every two days for a total
coverage of 26 days during the Cassini campaign to measure the upstream solar
wind parameters. This is the minimum coverage needed to ensure observations of
the aurora under solar wind pressure variations of more than a factor of two,
based on the solar wind pressure variations measured by Voyager 2 near Saturn
on the declining phase of solar activity. The team of proposers has carried
out a similar coordinated observing campaign of Jupiter during the Cassini
flyby, resulting in a set of papers and HST images on the cover of Nature on
28 February 2002.

The ACS Ultra Deep Field {UDF} is a survey carried out by using Director's
Discretionary time. The main science driver are galaxy evolution and
cosmology. The primary instrument is the Advanced Camera for Surveys but WFPC2
and NICMOS will also be used in parallel. The data will be made public. The
UDF consists of a single ultra-deep field {410 orbits in total} within the
CDF-S GOODS area. The survey will use four filters: F435W {55 orbits}, F606W
{55 orbits}, F775W {150 orbits}, and F850LP {150 orbits}. The F435W {B} and
F606W {V} exposures will be one magnitude deeper than the equivalent HDF
filters. The F775W {I} exposure will be 1.5 magnitude deeper than the
equivalent HDF exposure. The depth in F775W and F850LP is optimized for
searching very red objects - like z=6 galaxies - at the detection limit of the
F850LP image. The pointing will be RA{J2000}=3 32 40.0 and Decl.{J2000}=-27 48
00. These coordinates may change slightly due to guide star availability and
implementation issues. We will attempt to include in the field both a
spectroscopically confirmed z=5.8 galaxy and a spectroscopically confirmed
type Ia SN at z=1.3. The pointing avoids the gaps with the lowest effective
exposure on the Chandra ACIS image of CDFS. This basic structure of the survey
represents a consensus recommendation of a Scientific Advisory Committee to
the STScI Director Steven Beckwith. A local Working Group is looking in detail
at the implementation of the survey.

We propose a 300~ks HETGS observation simultaneous with a 4--orbit HST {UV}
observation to study the archetypal infrared quasar IRAS13349+2438. We will
explore its enigmatic properties and search for signatures of embedded dust
{implicated by the high extinction} in the warm absorber clouds of this
object. We will plan to propose for simultaneous optical observations to be
taken using the 6.5-m Magellan telescope {through the PI host institution}.
The X-ray spectra will give unprecedented high- resolution information for
this source necessary for probing in detail the physical properties, chemical
compositions and velocities of the material surrounding the AGN. We will
additionally assess the `unresolved transition array' {UTA} reported for this
object, and search for and measure the neutral Fe L edge seen in a similarly
reddened AGN. This will be complemented with simultaneous HST UV spectra to
determine the continuum shape and to assess whether the UV/X-ray absorbers in
this system are related. The Chandra data will also allow us to look for
narrow features at >2 keV. Such a broad waveband study of this object will
enable us to obtain a complete picture of the geometry and physics of the
system, as well as the physical processes which are responsible for the
variability in the absorber.

Chandra Observations of Mira AB symbiotic-like system obtained in Dec. 2003
detected an unexpected bright soft source {<0.7 keV} in addition to the
previously observed harder {1-4 keV} emission which has been attributed to the
accretion disk around Mira B. The newly discovered soft X-ray source could
indicate an instability in the accretion disk, an accretion related outburst
in the system, or a flare-like activity in Mira A. We request DD time to carry
out HST/STIS imaging and spectroscopy of Mira AB at UV wavelengths, where
signatures of these processes are very likely to be found. Because of the
likely transient nature of this phenomenon, timely HST observations are
critical for determining the nature and the characteristics of the soft X-ray
source and therefore we cannot wait for Cucle 13 observatios including TOO

We will undertake a 2 square degree imaging survey {Cosmic Evolution Survey --

wide field survey is essential to understand the interplay between Large Scale
Structure {LSS} evolution and the formation of galaxies, dark matter and AGNs
and is the one region of parameter space completely unexplored at present by
HST. The equatorial field was selected for its accessibility to all
ground-based telescopes and low IR background and because it will eventually
contain ~100, 000 galaxy spectra from the VLT-VIMOS instrument. The imaging
will detect over 2 million objects with I> 27 mag {AB, 10 sigma}, over 35, 000
Lyman Break Galaxies {LBGs} and extremely red galaxies out to z ~ 5. COSMOS is
the only HST project specifically designed to probe the formation and
evolution of structures ranging from galaxies up to Coma-size clusters in the
epoch of peak galaxy, AGN, star and cluster formation {z ~0.5 to 3}. The size
of the largest structures necessitate the 2 degree field. Our team is
committed to the assembly of several public ancillary datasets including the
optical spectra, deep XMM and VLA imaging, ground-based optical/IR imaging, UV
imaging from GALEX and IR data from SIRTF. Combining the full-spectrum
multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic coverage with ACS sub-kpc

Title:	    Mid-Ultraviolet Spectral Templates for Old Stellar Systems
PI:         Ruth Peterson

We propose a three-year program to provide both observational and theoretical
mid-ultraviolet {2300A -- 3100A} spectral templates for interpreting the age
and metallicity of globular clusters and elliptical galaxies from spectra of
their integrated light. The mid-UV is the region most directly influenced by
stellar age, and is observed directly in optical and infrared studies of
high-redshift quiescent systems. The reliability of age and metallicity
determinations remains questionable until non-solar metallicities and
abundance ratios are considered, and stars spanning the color-magnitude
diagram are included, as we propose here. With archival HST STIS spectra we
have improved the list of mid-UV atomic line parameters, then calculated
spectra from first principles which match observed spectra of standard stars
up to one- fourth solar metallicity. We will extend both observations and
calculations to stars of solar metallicity and beyond, and to those in
short-lived stages hotter than the main-sequence turnoff, stars not currently
well-represented in empirical libraries. The necessary line-list improvements
will come from new high-resolution mid-UV spectra of nine field stars. A key
application of the results of this program will be to the old systems now
being discovered as `Extremely Red Objects' at high redshifts. Reliable
age-dating of these places constraints on the epoch when large structures
first formed in the universe.

PI:         Pilar Ruiz-Lapuente

Type Ia supernovae are of key importance in cosmology. Empirical relations
allow their use as cosmological standard candles. The generally accepted
picture is that the exploding star is a C+O white dwarf which accretes matter
from a companion in a binary system. However, the nature of the companion is
still unknown. It could either be another WD, or be a giant, subgiant, or
main-sequence star. Calculations have shown that it is possible to distinguish
among those possibilities by the effect that the supernova explosion has on
the companion star. We propose to identify the companion star of the two
historical well-known SNeIa through ACS imaging of the targets complemented by
WFPC2 observations. A radial-velocity study of the stars in those two Galactic
SNeIa has been done from ground-based facilities. To obtain the full motion
vector of those stars, we plan to use ACS for high-resolution astrometry in
two different epochs. That should allow to detect motion imparted during the
explosion in the d ir ection perpendicular to the line of sight, down to a
level of a few milliarcsecs/yr.

The distances to neutron stars are a fundamental parameter that impacts
estimates of radii and luminosities, both of which have important
ramifications for neutron star heating and cooling and for the equation of
state of nuclear matter. A radius measured to 5% accuracy will provide useful
astrophysical constraints on the equation of matter at nuclear densities. This
requires an accurate measurment of the distance. Caraveo et al. have reported
a distance to the isolated pulsar Geminga based on three WFPC2 images. We have
not been able to reproduce that result. We request time with the ACS/WFC over
two years to obtain 4 images in order to determine the parallax of Geminga. In
addition to the general importance of understanding neutron star radii and
luminosities, this will provide specific insights into the history of gamma
ray pulsars in general, and of Geminga itself. We have obtained the first two

Title:	    Tracking the Evolution of a Knotty, High- Speed Jet in the Carbon

PI:         Raghvendra Sahai

The carbon star V Hydrae is experiencing heavy mass loss as it undergoes the
transition from AGB star to pre-planetary nebula. This is possibly the
earliest object known in this brief phase. Molecular observations reveal that
a bipolar nebula has been established even at this early stage. Using STIS on
the HST, we have discovered a high-velocity {> 200 km/s} jet or blob of gas
which was ejected only ~2 years ago from near the star. A second STIS
observation 11 months later clearly showed both its proper motion and the fact
that it is being strongly decelerated. We propose STIS monitoring of this
remarkable event for an additional 3 years, in order to: 1} obtain a precise
dynamical and cooling history of this blob, and 2} determine whether the
ejection of such blobs is associated with, or perhaps phased with, the 530-day
stellar period. This ejection event is likely to hold the key to understanding
why initially spherical mass outflows adopt a bipolar geometry during the
post-AGB phase of stellar evolution. We not only have the opportunity to look
on as the circumstellar envelope is sculpted by this and perhaps other
collimated mass ejections, but we also have an unprecedented chance to
constrain the mechanism for mass ejection, and thereby help solve a
long-standing puzzle. Finally, molecular line observations and our previous
STIS H$lpha$ observations show that the V Hya system contains a prominent,
central disk. We propose a follow-up study in H$lpha$ in order to better
define the disk properties, and thereby to determine whether the disk plays a
role in the collimation of the emerging blob. We will use the data to
constrain hydrodynamical models of collimated jet interactions with the
ambient circumstellar medium in V Hydrae, in order to set quantitative
constraints on the physical properties of the blobby outflow.

PI:         Mark Showalter

Last year, our Uranian ring and moon observing program {GO-9823} resulted in
the discovery of two moons, S/2003 U 1 and S/2003 U 2. We imaged two
additional small moons, Ophelia and S/1986 U 10, that had not been seen since
the Voyager encounter of 1986. Furthermore, our data show faint arcs and
clumps orbiting within the rings, which were not seen by Voyager and are
completely unexpected. We employed several "tricks" of the HRC to achieve this
remarkable senstivity; specifically, we used the CLEAR filter and oriented the
images so that the planet, though vastly overexposed, did not interfere with
the ring/moon region of interest to us. This allowed us to detect
25th-magnitude moons circling a 5th-magnitude planet. Now we propose to
complete the task by carrying out a comprehensive survey of the system using
the same techniques. Our goals are to recover the moons, better discern their
orbital elements, and learn more about the dynamics of the ring clumps. In
particular, we need to {1} understand the long-term stability of S/2003 U 2,
which orbits perilously close to the larger moon Belinda; {2} complete our
search for moons, which was only ~ 50% complete last year, and {3} better
understand how the clumps and arcs within the ring system might relate to
nearby "shepherding" moons, seen or unseen. This program is now a merger of

latter is the second year of our three-year program to study the light
scattering properties of Uranus's rings as they approach their edge-on

intermediate data products, would produce the observed radial velocity
amplitude, K = 66 ms with a companion mass of ~8 M_Jupiter. Such a mass would
induce in Upsilon Andromedae a perturbation semi-major axis, Alpha =
0arcs0012, easily within the reach of HST/FGS fringe tracking astrometry. The
proposed observations will yield a planetary mass, rather than, as previous
investigations have done, only suggest a planetary mass companion.

Title:	    Calibrating the Mass-Luminosity Relation at the End of the Main
	    Sequence
PI:         Todd Henry

We propose to use HST-FGS1R to calibrate the mass-luminosity relation {MLR}
for stars less massive than 0.2 Msun, with special emphasis on objects near
the stellar/brown dwarf border. Our goals are to determine M_V values to 0.05
magnitude, masses to 5 than double the number of objects with masses
determined to be less than 0.20 Msun. This program uses the combination of
HST-FGS3/FGS1R at optical wavelengths and ground-based infrared interferometry
to examine nearby, subarcsecond binary systems. The high precision
measurements with HST-FGS3/FGS1R {to 1 mas in the separations} for these faint
targets {V = 10--15} simply cannot be equaled by any ground based technique.
As a result of these measurements, we are deriving high quality luminosities
and masses for the components in the observed systems, and characterizing
their spectral energy distributions from 0.5 to 2.2 Mum. Several of the
objects included have M < 0.1 Msun, placing them at the very end of the
stellar main sequence. Three of the targets are brown dwarf candidates,
including the current low mass record holder, GJ 1245C, with a mass of 0.062
+/- 0.004 Msun. The payoff of this proposal is high because all 10 of the
systems selected have already been resolved with HST- FGS3/FGS1R during Cycles
5--10 and contain most of the reddest objects for which masses can be
determined.

Title:	    Accurate Mass Determination of the Ancient White Dwarf   ER 8
	    Through Astrometric Microlensing
PI:         Kailash Sahu

We propose to determine the mass of the very cool white dwarf ER 8 through
astrometric microlensing. We have predicted that ER 8 will pass very close to
a 15th-mag background star in January 2006, with an impact parameter of less
than 0.05 arcsec. As it passes in front, it will cause a deflection of the
background star's image by >8 milliarcsec, an amount easily detectable with
HST/FGS. The gravitational deflection angle depends only on the distances and
relative positions of the stars, and on the mass of the white dwarf. Since the
distances and positions can be determined precisely before the event, the
astrometric measurement offers a unique and direct method to measure the mass
of the white dwarf to high accuracy {<5%}. Unlike all other stellar mass
determinations, this technique works for single stars {but only if they are
nearby and of sufficient mass}. The mass of ER 8 is of special interest
because it is a member of the Galactic halo, and appears to be the oldest
known field white dwarf. This object can thus set a lower limit on the age of
the Galactic halo, but since white-dwarf cooling rates depend on their masses,
the mass is a necessary ingredient in the age determination. As a byproduct,
we will obtain an accurate parallax for ER 8, and thus its luminosity and
{from its effective temperature} its radius. Such quantities are at present
rather poorly known for the coolest white dwarfs, and will provide strong
constraints on white-dwarf physics.

We propose to measure the parallaxes of 10 Galactic Cepheid variables. When
these parallaxes {with 1-sigma precisions of 10% or better} are added to our
recent HST FGS parallax determination of delta Cep {Benedict et al 2002}, we
anticipate determining the Period-Luminosity relation zero point with a 0.03
mag precision. In addition to permitting the test of assumptions that enter
into other Cepheid distance determination techniques, this calibration will
reintroduce Galactic Cepheids as a fundamental step in the extragalactic
distance scale ladder. A Period-Luminosity relation derived from solar
metallicity Cepheids can be applied directly to extragalactic solar
metallicity Cepheids, removing the need to bridge with the Large Magellanic
Cloud and its associated metallicity complications.

PI:         Douglas Gies

The O-type star 15 Mon {HD 47839} was recently discovered to be an astrometric
and spectroscopic binary with a period of 25 years; it is the first known
O-star system to bridge the observational gap between the period regimes
normally probed by these techniques. An analysis of both the radial velocity
curve and astrometric orbit yields the masses of the components and distance
to the system. Continuing radial velocity and HST/FGS astrometric measurements
will lead to a definitive orbit and yield key information about the masses of
O-type stars. FGS TRANS mode measurements of separation, position angle, and
magnitude difference {begun in Cycle 5} are needed to link existing speckle
observations and anticipated observations with the CHARA Array optical
interferometer. In addition, field astrometry measurements {FGS POS mode} will
provide the proper motion, parallax, and the binary motion around the center
of mass. The POS data will provide an accurate estimate of the mass ratio and
an improved estimate of distance, and taken together with the spectroscopic
and astrometric orbital data, we will obtain masses for both components
accurate to a few percent.

Title:	    Dynamical Masses and Radii of Four White Dwarf Stars
PI:         Edmund Nelan

The cool white dwarf stars WD1639+153 and WD1818+126 were recently resolved by
HST FGS1r to be double degenerate binary systems with projected separations of
112 mas and 174 mas respectively. At a distance of less than 50 pc they may
both have periods shorter than about 20 years, making them ideal candidates
for follow up studies for dynamical mass determinations. This will increase
the number of white dwarfs with dynamical mass measurements from the current 4
up to 8. Continued observations of these white dwarfs along with nearby field
stars with the FGS will accuractely determine the orbital elements and
parallax of each system. The mass and radius of all four white dwarfs can be
determined to an unprecedented 1%, making it possible to test and calibrate
the theoretical white dwarf mass radius relation at the cool end of the
cooling curve for the DA and DC subclasses. Since the components of the binary
are coeval, once the mass and radius, and hence the cooling age of each star
is known, it will be possible to estimate the relation between the initial
mass and final mass for all four white dwarfs. We are requesting a total of 4
HST orbits per year for the next three cycles to initiate the process that
will result in a determination of the mass and radius of the four white
dwarfs.

PI:         M. Sean O'Brien

PG 0122+200 is a pulsating hot white dwarf that is believed to radiate more
energy as neutrinos than it does as photons. We propose to measure with FGS
the trigonometric parallax of PG 0122+200 and thereby determine its distance,
luminosity, and mass. Ongoing investigations from the ground will infer the
neutrino luminosity through its effect on the pulsation periods, thus testing
standard and non-standard lepton theory, but the stellar mass must first be
known. The pulsation spectrum of PG 0122+200 admits two alternative
seismological interpretations, each implying a different mass, luminosity, and
distance. Measurement of an accurate distance will resolve the matter once and
for all and precisely determine the stellar mass. This project represents the
first test of lepton physics in dense {log rho = 6} plasma and is relevant to
the many areas of stellar physics in which neutrino interactions are
important, including recent theories intended to solve the solar-neutrino
problem.

Title:	    Parallaxes of Extreme Halo Subgiants: Calibrating Globular Cluster
	    Distances and the Ages of the Oldest Stars
PI:         Don Vandenberg

The ages of the oldest stars are a key constraint on the evolution of our
Galaxy, the history of star formation, and cosmological models. These ages are
usually determined from globular clusters. However, it is alternatively
possible to determine ages of extreme Population II subgiants in the solar
neighborhood based on trigonometric parallaxes, without any recourse to
clusters. This approach completely avoids the vexing issues of cluster
distances, reddenings, and chemical compositions. There are 3 known nearby,
extremely metal-deficient Pop II subgiants with Hipparcos parallax errors of
6-11% which are available for such age determinations. At present, based on
the latest isochrones, the derived ages of these stars {HD 84937, HD 132475,
and HD 140283} are all close to 14 Gyr, uncomfortably close to or higher than
current estimates of the age of the universe. However, the errors in the
Hipparcos parallaxes imply uncertainties of at least 2 Gyr in the ages of the
3 stars. We propose to measure parallaxes of these three Pop II subgiants
using HST's Fine Guidance Sensor 1R. We expect to reduce the Hipparcos
parallax error bars by factors of 5-6, providing the most stringent test yet
of current theoretical stellar models of Pop II stars and pushing the age
uncertainties to below 0.5 Gyr. These data will also provide a major new
constraint on the distance scale of globular clusters, with wide implications
for stellar evolution and the calibration of Pop II standard candles.

This is a continuation of a program carried out in Cycles 7--10. Sakurai's
Object {V4334 Sgr} presents a ``once-in-a-lifetime'' opportunity for real-time
observations of a star undergoing a final helium thermal pulse. The star rose
from obscurity to become an 11th-magnitude ``born-again'' hydrogen-deficient
red giant in 1995-96, and currently it is undergoing episodes of atmospheric
dust formation. If it follows the pattern that the similar object V605 Aql
took early in the 20th century, it will soon begin evolving back to high
temperature. During the subsequent few years, it will begin to {re}-ionize its
large, faint, old planetary nebula as well as the new ejecta, and we should be
able to witness the re-establishment and evolution of a fast stellar wind as
the effective temperature increases. When the star does begin to heat up, we
will initiate Target-of-Opportunity STIS observations to monitor the star's
spectroscopic development in the UV at regular intervals, continuing over the
next 3 Cycles. We will also use ACS/HRC twice over the next 3 years to
continue our monitoring of the expansion of the ejecta and to determine the
star's proper motion. In combination with ground-based monitoring {optical,
IR, and mm}, we will thus produce the first detailed case study of a thermal
pulse, as the star re-traces its evolution across the HR diagram from the AGB
back to the hot planetary-nebula-nucleus phase.

of three visual binary stars that will ultimately yield fundamental
astrophysical results, once their orbits and masses are determined. Our
targets are the following: {1} Procyon {P = 41 yr}, for which our first WFPC2
images yielded an extremely accurate angular separation of the bright F star
and its much fainter white-dwarf companion. Combined with ground-based
astrometry of the bright star, our observation significantly revised downward
the derived masses, and brought Procyon A into excellent agreement with
theoretical evolutionary tracks for the first time. With the continued
monitoring proposed here, we will obtain masses to an accuracy of better than
1%, providing a testbed for theories of both Sun-like stars and white dwarfs.
{2} G 107-70, a close double white dwarf {P = 19 yr} that promises to add two
accurate masses to the tiny handful of white-dwarf masses that are directly
known from dynamical measurements. {3} Mu Cas {P = 21 yr}, a famous
metal-deficient G dwarf for which accurate masses will lead to the stars'
helium contents, with cosmological implications.

Title:	    Trigonometric Calibration of the Period- Luminosity Relations for
	    Fundamental and First-Overtone Galactic Cepheids
PI:         Howard Bond

Cepheids are the primary distance indicators for the extragalactic distance
scale and the Hubble constant. The Hubble Constant Key Project set the
zero-point for their Cepheid distance scale by adopting a distance to the LMC,
averaged over a variety of techniques. However, different methods give an LMC
distance modulus ranging from 18.1 to 18.8, and the uncertainty in the Cepheid
zero-point is now the largest contributor to the error budget for H_0.
Moreover, the low metallicity of the LMC raises additional concerns, since the
PL relation probably depends on metallicity. The zero-point can be determined
from Hipparcos parallaxes of Galactic Cepheids out to several hundred parsecs,
but with a typical parallax error of 0.5-1 mas, the Hipparcos error bars are
uncomfortably large for this demanding application. By contrast, HST's FGS1R
interferometer can achieve astrometric accuracy of 0.2 mas. We propose to use
FGS1R to determine trigonometric parallaxes for a sample of 9 nearby Cepheids,
including both fundamental {F} and first-overtone {FO} pulsators. We show that
the improvement in the PL relations for F and FO Cepheids will be dramatic. We
will determine the PL slopes from our nearby solar- metallicity sample alone,
without recourse to nearby galaxies and the issue of [Fe/H] dependence. The
zero-point will be determined robustly to about 0.05 mag, based on accurate,
purely geometrical measurements. All of this can be achieved in the next few
years with HST, without having to wait for the technically demanding and risky
SIM and GAIA missions well into the next decade.

PI:         Edward Guinan

The chromospheric H I Ly_alpha 1215.6 feature is the dominant source of
short-wave emission in the Sun and solar-type stars, contributing about 80-90%
of the total FUV flux and 30-60% of the total flux between 1 and 1500 A. Also,
this important chromospheric line is the major cooling channel for cool star
atmospheres. Accurate Ly_alpha fluxes are the only missing element of our
ongoing "Sun in Time" program. This program studies a sample of single G0-5 V
stars with well-known physical properties that serve as proxies for the Sun
{and solar-mass stars} over their main sequence lifetimes. One of the major
goals of the program is the determination of the spectral irradiance of the
early Sun. Our analyses indicate that the strong XUV emissions of the young
Sun have played a crucial role in the developing planetary system. In
particular, the expected strong Ly_alpha line flux may have greatly influenced
the photoionization, photochemical evolution and possible erosion of planetary
atmospheres, as well as played a role in the origin and development of life on
Earth. The "Sun in Time" data can also be applied to investigate the
atmospheric loss of exoplanets around solar-type stars resulting from XUV
heating, which can eventually lead to the evaporation of "hot Jupiters". We
propose to use HST/STIS-MAMA/E140M to determine accurate FUV and Ly-alpha
fluxes and irradiances for 4 representative solar proxies with ages from 130
Myr to 6.7 Gyr. It is only with HST's high-resolution UV spectroscopy {to
correct for ISM absorption} and the small aperture {to eliminate geocoronal
emission} that the stellar Ly-alpha profile can be reliably modeled and its
flux measured. The proposed study is of capital importance in reconstructing
the evolutionary histories of exoplanets already known and additional planets
that missions such as COROT, Kepler, SIM, and Darwin/TPF will discover in the

Title:	    Towards an Accurate Calibration of the Galactic Cepheid P-L Zero
	    Point
PI:         Edward Guinan

The young open cluster NGC 7790 is unique and astrophysically important
because it contains three classical Cepheid variables {CF Cas, CE Cas A, and
CE Cas B}. If the distance of NGC 7790 were known with certainty, these
Cepheids would define the zero point for the galactic Cepheid
Period-Luminosity {P-L} relationship. By a stroke of good luck, NGC 7790 also
contains a 10th-mag eclipsing binary located near the turnoff of the
main-sequence of the color-magnitude diagram of the cluster. This important
eclipsing binary has been little studied until now and contains two B1IV-V+B3V
stars with an orbital period of P=6.005 days. With HST we propose to secure
the accurate distance and reddening of QX Cas {and thus of the Cepheids} by
using eclipsing binaries as precise standard candles, as we have demonstrated
in our work on the Large Magellanic Cloud. With absolute radii, temperatures,
and luminosities of the stars known from ground-based and HST observations,
the method is essentially geometric and free from many of the uncertainties
that plague other less direct methods. Light and radial velocity curve data
will be combined with the proposed HST/STIS spectrophotometry {1150-8000 A} to
determine the physical properties of the eclipsing binary and thus to secure
an accurate distance and reddening for NGC 7790. The determination of the
stars' temperatures, reddenings and chemical abundances, and therefore the
cluster's distance, with the necessary accuracy can only be accomplished with
HST. According to our previous experience, we expect a resulting distance
determination with an accuracy of about 2-3%. HST/STIS spectrophotometry will
be carried out also for the three Cepheids to determine their properties and
individual reddenings. Thus, the proposed HST observations could help
eliminate the current nagging uncertainty of the galactic Cepheid zero point
and provide the key for a firm calibration of the P-L relationship.

We will carry out a STIS/NUV-MAMA snapshot imaging survey of the most compact
powerful radio galaxies, the Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum {GPS} sources and
Compact Steep Spectrum {CSS} sources. These objects are as powerful as the
large radio doubles but are much smaller {and younger} and are crucial to our
understanding not only of how radio-loud active galactic nuclei {AGN} form and
evolve, but also what role they play in the evolution of galaxies. A very
direct and robust way to address these issues is by high resolution imaging of
the host galaxies of these sources in the UV. This has never been done before
for a sample of these very compact sources, since previous HST/UV imaging
programs have focussed on the larger radio galaxies. The UV emission can
provide crucial information about any recent star formation that may have
occurred as a result of ongoing accretion, mergers, interactions, or
triggering by the radio source. By comparing the starburst properties of GPS,
CSS, and large scale radio sources, we will be able to constrain the evolution
of massive star formation as a function of the relative age of the radio
source. {Note, due to the failure of STIS, these observations will be carried
out using the ACS/HRC}.

Title:	    Imaging the Chemical Distribution in Type Ia SN Ejecta
PI:         Robert Fesen

We know Type Ia supernovae are thermonuclear explosions of CO white dwarfs,
but we don't know the specifics of how the nuclear burning process proceeds
from the core outward once it starts. The thermonuclear instability is thought
to start off as a subsonic, turbulent deflagration or burning wave but then,
at some point, may transition into a blast or detonation wave. In such
"delayed detonation" models, differences between normal and subluminous Type
Ia SNe reflect differences in the amount of burning that has occurred in the
pre-detonation phase. More burning helps to pre-expand the WD before passage
of the detontation wave, which then results in different final element
abundances and internal Fe-rich ejecta structure. Directly imaging the 2-D
chemical distribution of ejecta from a Type Ia SN is actually possible in the
case of the subluminous Type Ia SN 1885, which occurred on the near-side of
M31's central bulge. This 119 year old remnant is visible -- from its core to
its outer edge -- via strong optical/UV Ca and Fe line absorptions.
Remarkably, the SNR appears to still be in a nearly free expansion phase,
meaning that the elemental stratification seen present today accurately
reflects SN Ia explosive nucleosynthesis physics. We propose to obtain ACS
WFC/HRC images of SN 1885 in order to take advantage of this extraordinary
situation: Having a young, nearby Type Ia SN remnant visible in silhouette
against a galaxy-size light table. These unique observations will reveal a SN
Ia's Ca and Fe ejecta distribution, density structure, sphericity, and
ionization state as a function of expansion velocity, thereby confronting
various SN Ia models with detailed ejecta stratification and expansion
velocity maps.

Seven years after the afterglow detections that revolutionized studies of the
long-soft gamma-ray bursts, not even one afterglow of a short-hard GRB has
been seen, and the nature of these events has become one of the most important
problems in GRB research. The forthcoming Swift satellite will report
few-arcsecond localizations for short-hard bursts in minutes, however,
enabling prompt, deep optical afterglow searches for the first time. Discovery
and observation of the first short-hard optical afterglows will answer most of
the critical questions about these events: What are their distances and
energies? Do they occur in distant galaxies, and if so, in which regions of
those galaxies? Are they the result of collimated or quasi-spherical
explosions? In combination with an extensive rapid-response ground-based
campaign, we propose to make the critical high-sensitivity HST TOO
observations that will allow us to answer these questions. If theorists are
correct in attributing the short-hard bursts to binary neutron star
coalescence events, then the short-hard bursts are signposts to the primary
targeted source population for ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, and
short-hard burst studies will have a vital role to play in guiding their

PI:         Scott Anderson

Close binaries are fundamental to the dynamical stability and evolution of
globular clusters, but large populations have been extremely difficult to
identify. Chandra X-ray images provide a revolutionary resource, revealing a
few to dozens of low-luminosity X-ray sources in every cluster deeply
examined; our own Chandra programs uniformly study these ubiquitous X-ray
sources {close binaries and their progeny} in 11 clusters. However, definitive
understanding of the nature of the various X-ray subpopulations requires the
identification of optical counterparts, and HST is the demonstrated key in
these crowded environments. We thus propose a proven, efficient, and uniform,
HST multicolor imaging program for optical identifications in 6 of our
clusters with Chandra data on-hand, but which lack adequate optical images in
the HST archive. The proposed ACS images will permit statistical
classifications into the various subtypes: CVs, qLMXBs, BY Dra's/RS CVn's {and
MSPs}. A unique aspect of our program is that our clusters span a range of
physical properties such as central concentration, cluster size, and
mass--essential ingredients in the formation, evolution, and dynamical roles
of cluster binaries. Exploiting this range of properties, we have identified a
relation that provides the first compelling link between the number of X-ray
sources and the predicted stellar encounter frequency in globular cluster
cores. But further progress in understanding the details implicit in this
relationship {e.g., whether CVs and qLMXBs formed primarily via stellar
encounters, while BY Dra's/RS CVn's are mainly primordial binaries} demands
uniform optical identifications for multiple clusters, spanning the full range
physical properties.

Recently, three variable stars have been identified as likely accreting binary

revealed periodicities of 5-10 minutes, making them the closest binaries known
as well as strong sources of gravitational wave emission. Such short-period
accreting binaries form the cornerstone to our understanding of binary
formation and evolution, in particular of the large double white dwarf
population in our galaxy, a candidate progenitor population for Type Ia
supernovae. We propose to obtain the first UV observations of these objects
using STIS in order to {i} determine the temperature of the primary and the
composition of their donor stars, {ii} correlate the UV variability with other
wavebands and determine if the periods are indeed orbital, {iii} look for
dynamical signatures of direct-impact accretion that is expected to govern the
survival rate of double white dwarfs. These UV observations are essential in
order to unequivocally determine whether these are indeed the most compact

Title:	    Microarcsecond Imaging of a Gravitationally Lensed QSO: 2237+0305
PI:         Rachel Webster

The microarcsecond scale structure of the central region of the
gravitationally lensed quasar, 2237+0305, can be determined from its
wavelength dependent lightcurve if viewed during a microlensing event. We are
monitoring the QSO from the ground at regular intervals to ascertain the onset
of a microlensing event. STIS spectra will then be taken and compared with the
spectra taken after the event. As the microlensing event occurs, we will
measure wavelength- dependent changes in the continuum, and also the
variations in lines with different ionizations. Thus we will use microlensing
to directly probe the structure of the source QSO on microarcsecond scales --
a factor of ten smaller than those measured by indirect techniques such as
reverberation mapping. An already approved CHANDRA Cycle 3 GO program will
provide complementary X-ray data, thus greatly increasing the wavelength range
over which we hope to probe the quasar's inner structure.

Title:	    Physical Processes in Orion's Veil:  A High Resolution UV
	    Absorption Study of the Line of Sight towards the Trapezium
PI:         Gary Ferland

Star formation is governed by a complex interplay among magnetic, thermal,
turbulent and gravitational energies. Of these, magnetic energies are the most
difficult to measure. Yet magnetic energies are crucial to the evolution of
molecular clouds if they are comparable to other energies. Unfortunately,
magnetic field strength measurements are sparse. Moreover, detailed field
strength maps exist in only one region of the ISM, the veil of neutral
material in front of the Orion Nebula. From the Zeeman effect in 21cm HI
absorption lines, we have accurate maps of the line-of-sight field strength in
two independent velocity components of the veil. Therefore, the veil presents
a unique laboratory for study of magnetic effects in star forming regions. We
have recently combined archival UV absorption line data with photoionization
models to estimate the veil's density, temperature and level of ionization. On
this basis, we infer that magnetic energies far exceed turbulent and thermal
energies in at least one HI velocity component. This component is magnetically
unique. All other data about star forming regions suggest equipartition
between magnetic and turbulent energies. Our analysis of physical conditions
in Orion's veil suffers from an important limitation. Existing UV absorption
line data have insufficient spectral resolution to separate the two HI
velocity components. Therefore, our models reflect average conditions in the
two components. Yet actual conditions are likely to be quite different since
one component must lie closer to the source of ionization. We propose to use
STIS to obtain high resolution UV spectra of Theta 1 Ori B. These data will
allow us to model the two velocity components separately. We can then estimate
magnetic and other energies in the two components. We will determine if the
apparent magnetic uniqueness of one component applies to both, and we will
estimate the distances of each component from the ionizing stars. This study
will provide the most comprehensive information obtainable about the role of
magnetic effects in a star forming region.

Title:	    Where is the Wind in 1H0707-495?
PI:         Karen Leighly

We propose three observations using HST STIS of the narrow-line Seyfert 1
galaxy 1H 0707-495 to be coordinated with already-approved deep exposures
using FUSE. A previous HST observation of 1H 0707-495 revealed strongly
blueshifted high-ionization lines, suggesting an origin in an outflowing wind.
Detailed photoionization modeling reveals that the wind line fluxes and ratios
are consistent with two solutions: a high-density, high-column solution,
originating close to the central engine, and a low-density, low-column
solution, located much further out. These two locations, interestingly,
correspond to those predicted by two different physical models for winds in
AGNs. We can differentiate between these models by observing emission line
variability on two time scales, and examining relative variability of OVI
obtained by FUSE and CIV and other lines obtained by HST. We will also look
for profile variability, constrain velocity ionization stratification through
a detailed study of the profiles, and investigate metallicity, which has been
suggested to be high in NLS1s. This program, requiring only a modest amount of
time, is expected to make significant contributions to our understanding of
outflows in AGN, and the structure, origin and metallicity of the broad-line
region.

We propose to exploit the exceptional spatial resolution of HST to
definitively show whether the SMC is tidally elongated along the
line-of-sight, and therefore the status of the Milky Way's
interaction/destruction of the Magellanic Clouds. We use BVI ACS images of
several crowded SMC fields in the region predicted by models of the orbit and
tidal evolution of the Magellanic Clouds {and by observations of Cepheids} to
have a large depth. We exploit the red clump feature {and the rarer true
horizontal branch} to derive the depth. Specifically, we will observe six
fields along the predicted region of maximum distance gradient of the SMC,
along with two ACS fields and several WFPC2 fields in the archives, to map out
the depth of the SMC in this region. We are searching for substructure, such
as a tidal tail, that may be present. Crowding in this region of the SMC is so
severe that this project cannot be done from the ground.

We propose imaging a rich protocluster, 0316-26 at z = 3.13, with 31 confirmed
Lya cluster members. The bright radio galaxy host is identified with the
progenitor of the dominant cluster galaxy. Because its redshift places Lya
into an ACS narrow-band filter, the protocluster provides a unique laboratory
for studying galaxies at a crucial epoch in the evolution of the Universe. We
shall {i} measure and compare sizes, morphologies and colors of galaxies from
populations detected using 4 different selection techniques {Lyman and 4000A
breaks, Lya and [OIII] excesses}, {ii} study effects of an overdense
environment by comparing the properties of protocluster galaxies with z~3
field galaxies from GOODS, {iii} study effects of evolution by relating our
data to observations of similar protocluster/cluster targets at redshifts z =

cluster galaxies by investigating the spatial distribution, Lya equivalent
widths and other properties within the 5" radio galaxy host. The ultimate aim
is to disentangle the history of structure development and stellar evolution
for rich clusters of galaxies.

PI:         Annette Ferguson

Over the past several years, our group has conducted a large panoramic
ground-based imaging survey of resolved luminous stars in M31 using the INT
Wide-Field Camera. Our now complete survey covers 40 square degrees around
M31, extending to a major axis distance of ~60 kpc. This survey has led to the
discovery of numerous spatial density and/or colour {metallicity?} variations
within the M31 halo and outer disk, and interim results motivated a successful
Cycle 11 HST/ACS program to obtain deep colour-magnitude diagrams for six
regions exhibiting the most prominent stellar substructure known at that time,
including the giant stellar stream and the clump of stars near the anomolous
cluster, G1. The present proposal requests time to augment our Cycle 11
program with observations of two new features, a very low surface brightness
fragment lying 3 degrees north-east of center and a high surface brightness
spur of emission in the south-western half of the galaxy, which we have
discovered since 2001. Deep colour-magnitude diagrams reaching 2-3 magnitudes
below the horizontal branch will be constructed, allowing detailed
characterization of the luminous evolved stellar populations via the red giant
metallicity distribution, the luminous asymptotic giant branch, the horizontal
branch morphology and the red clump, as well as the detection of a
main-sequence that may be present from any younger component. Together the
Cycle 11 and 13 pointings target all prominent stellar substructure known to
exist within 60 kpc of M31.

We intend to use the ACS/WFC to measure structural parameters {half light
radius, King core radius and concentration parameter} of individual globular
clusters {GCs} in NGC 1399. Very little is known about structural parameters
of globular clusters as a function of radius outside the Local Group. The
proposed observations, arranged in a 3x3 ACS mosaic, will allow us to perform
the first detailed wide-field study of structural parameters of globular
clusters in a giant elliptical galaxy. In particular we will: 1} study the
size-galactocentric distance relation of globular clusters out to ~55 kpc
{~1.6 eff. radius of the GCS} and determine whether the observed differences
in sizes between metal-rich and metal-poor globular cluster in early-type
galaxies are primordial and thereby reflect fundamental differences in
formation, or are due to projection effects; 2} match the GC position observed
with HST/ACS with X-ray binaries identified over the full Chandra field, and
use the above sizes to constrain physical models for X-ray binary formation in
GCs. 3} The wealth of ground-based data available for this system
{photometry+spectroscopy}, will allow us to correlate the structural
properties with other GC properties, such as their chemical composition,

PI:         Charles Alcock

We request second epoch observations with ACS of Magellanic Cloud fields
centered on the 40 quasars in the LMC and SMC for which we have first epoch
Cycle 11 data. The new data will determine the systemic proper motion of the
Clouds. An extensive astrometric analysis of the first epoch data shows that
follow-up observations with a two year baseline will allow us to measure the
proper motion of the clouds to within 0.022 mas/year in each of the two
orthogonal directions {assuming that we can image 25 quasars, i.e., with a
realistic Snapshot Program completion rate}. The best weighted combination of
all previous measurements has a seven times larger error than what we expect.
We will determine the proper motion of the clouds with 2% accuracy. When
combined with HI data for the Magellanic Stream this will constrain both the
mass distribution in the Galactic Halo and theoretical models for the origin
of the Magellanic Stream. Previous measurements are too crude for such
constraints. Our data will provide by far the most accurate proper motion
measurement for any Milky Way satellite.

Title:	    Determining the Origin of Virgo's Intracluster Stars
PI:         Robin Ciardullo

Intracluster stars constitute about 20% of the total stellar population of a
typical galaxy cluster, and their existence provides a vital clue for our
understanding of cluster formation and evolution. However, to exploit their
probative value, we need to know their origins: are they the remnants of dwarf
galaxies, long since destroyed by the cluster potential, or have the stars
been harassed from their parent galaxies at recent epochs? To answer this
question, we propose to use the Wide-Field Channel of ACS to make an I, {V-I}
color-magnitude diagram of Virgo's intracluster stars. From the position and
morphology of the population's red giant branch, we will be able to determine
the metallicity distribution function of the stars, and thereby determine
their likely origin and ejection mechanisms. Only HST with the ACS has the
sensitivity and resolution to perform this fundamental measurement. This
program has two options. Option one uses conventional methods of cluster
photometry and requires 37 orbits of exposure time. Option two involves a
novel analysis technique, which promises to achieve most of the same science
in two-thirds the time {23 orbits}. We describe this alternative method of
analysis and demonstrate its use via simulations.

PI:         Scott Anderson

The reionization of intergalactic helium is thought to have occurred between
redshifts of about 3 and 4. The study of HeII Lyman-alpha absorption towards a
half-dozen quasars at 2.7<z<3.5 demonstrates the great potential of such
probes of the IGM, but the current critically-small sample limits confidence
in resulting cosmological inferences. The requisite unobscured quasar
sightlines to high-redshift are extremely rare, especially due to severe
absorption in random intervening Lyman-limit systems, but SDSS provides
hundreds of bright, new quasars at such redshifts potentially suitable for
HeII studies. Our cycle 13 SNAP program proposes to verify the UV
detectability of 40 new, bright, z>2.9 SDSS quasars, but with special emphasis
on extending helium studies to the highest redshift sightlines. Our proposed
approach has already proven successful, and additional sightlines will enable
follow-up spectal observations to measure the spectrum and evolution of the
ionizing background radiation, the density of intergalactic baryons, and the
epoch of reionization of the IGM.

Title:	    HST / Chandra Monitoring of a Dramatic Flare in the M87 Jet
PI:         John Biretta

As the nearest galaxy with an optical jet, M87 affords an unparalleled
opportunity to study extragalactic jet phenomena at the highest resolution.
During 2002, HST and Chandra monitoring of the M87 jet detected a dramatic
flare in knot HST-1 located ~1" from the nucleus. As of late 2003 its
brightness has increased twenty-fold in the optical band, and continues to
increase sharply; the X-rays show a similarly dramatic outburst. In both bands
HST-1 now greatly exceeds the nucleus in brightness. To our knowledge this is
the first incidence of an optical or X-ray outburst from a jet region which is
spatially distinct from the core source; this presents an unprecedented
opportunity to study the processes responsible for non-thermal variability and
the X-ray emission. We propose seven epochs of HST/STIS monitoring during
Cycle 13, as well as seven epochs of Chandra/ACIS observation {5ksec each}. We
also include a brief HRC/ACS observations that will be used to gather spectral
information and map the magnetic field structure. This monitoring is continued
into Cycles 14 and 15. The results of this investigation are of key importance
not only for understanding the nature of the X-ray emission of the M87 jet,
but also for understanding flares in blazar jets, which are highly variable,
but where we have never before been able to resolve the flaring region in the
optical or X-rays. These observations will allow us to test synchrotron
emission models for the X-ray outburst, constrain particle acceleration and
loss timescales, and study the jet dynamics associated with this flaring
component. Revisions 6 Oct 2004: Due to the demise of STIS we are replacing

Title:	    The Evolution and Assembly of Galactic Disks: Integrated studies

PI:         Marc Davis

This project is a 126-orbit imaging survey in F606W/F814W ACS to measure the
evolution of galaxy disks from redshift z = 1.4 to the present. By combining
HST imaging with existing observations in the Extended Groth Strip, we can for
the first time simultaneously determine the mass in dark matter that underlies
disks, the mass in stars within those disks, and the rate of formation of new
stars from gas in the disks, for samples of >1, 000 objects. ACS observations
are critical for this work, both for reliable identifications of disks and for
determining their sizes and inclinations. Combining these data with the
kinematics measured from high-resolution Keck DEIMOS spectra will give
dynamical masses that include dark matter. Stellar masses can be measured
separately using ground-based BRIK and Spitzer IRAC GTO data, while
cross-calibrated star formation rates will come from DEEP2 spectra, GALEX, and
Spitzer/MIPS. The field chosen is the only one where all multiwavelength data
needed will be available in the near term. These data will show how the
fundamental properties of disks {luminosity, rotation speed, scale length} and
their scaling relations have evolved since z~1, and also will measure the
build-up of stellar disks directly, providing fundamental tests of disk
formation and evolution. In addition to the above study of disk galaxies, the
data will also be used to measure the evolution of red-sequence galaxies and
their associated stellar populations. ACS images will yield the number of
red-sequence galaxies versus time, together with their total associated
stellar mass. ACS images are crucial to classify red-sequence galaxies into
normal E/S0s versus peculiar types and to measure radii, which will complete
the suite of fundamental structural parameters needed to study evolution. We
will measure the zeropoints of major scaling laws {Fundamental Plane, radius
versus sigma}, as well as evolution in characteristic quantities such as L*,
v*, and r*. Stellar population ages will be estimated from high-resolution
Keck DEIMOS spectra and compared to SED evolution measured from GALEX, HST,
Spitzer, and ground-based colors. Important for both disk and red-galaxy
programs are parallel exposures to be taken with both NIC3 {J and H} and WFPC2
{B}. These are arranged so that ACS, WFPC2, and NIC3 all overlap where
possible , providing a rich data set of galaxies imaged with all three HST
cameras from B to H. These data will be used to measure restframe visible
morphologies and UV star-formation rates for galaxies near the edge of the
survey, to discover and count EROs below the Keck spectroscopic limit of R =
24, and to provide an improved database of photometric redshifts for galaxies
in the overlap regions.

Title:	    Unveiling the Progenitors and Physics of Cosmic Explosions
PI:         Shrinivas Kulkarni

GRBs and XRFs are clearly highly asymmetric explosions and require a
long-lived power source {central engine}. In contrast, nearby core-collapse
events are essentially spherical explosions. However, the failure of spherical
neutrino driven collapses has led to the idea that asymmetric energy release
is essential for the explosion. The recent finding of a Type Ic SN in GRB
030329, the association of the low energy event GRB 980425 with SN 1998bw, the
theoretical development discussed above and the rise of collapsar models make
it timely to consider whether all these explosions contain engines. Given the
uncertainties in theoretical modeling it is clear that observations are needed
to guide models. A priori there is little reason to expect connection between
the ultra-relativistic jet that powers the GRB and the explosive
nucleosynthesis of the ~0.5 solar masses of Nickel-56 that powers the
accompanying supernova. We propose a comprehensive program of ACS photometric
searches {and measurements} for SNe associated with GRBs and XRFs. In concert,
we will undertake ground-based spectroscopy to determine velocity widths, and
measure engine parameters from pan-chromatic afterglow observations. Our goal
is to produce a comprehensive database of engine and SN physical parameters
against which theoretical modeling will be guided.

Post-asymptotic-giant-branch {PAGB} stars of spectral types A-F are the

observations, that PAGB stars have tremendous potential as highly efficient
standard candles and as tracers of halo populations and late stellar
evolution. Our analysis of PAGB stars in archival HST images of M32, based on
the equivalent of one orbit of HST time, precisely reproduces the accepted
distance. We propose to obtain ACS/WFC and WFPC2 images of fields in the halo
of M81, as another test of the PAGB method. We show that 4 orbits of HST data
will produce a distance of comparable accuracy to the much more laborious
Cepheid technique. If successful on M81, we will propose in the next cycle to
measure the distance to Virgo using our method, a distance ladder that has
only two rungs {trigonometric parallaxes of subdwarfs to calibrate PAGB stars
in globular clusters, and then PAGB stars in Virgo}.

We propose to obtain a UV spectrum of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 {NLS1} galaxy
NGC 4051 on a target-of-opportunity basis when it goes into a faint state for
the purpose of exploring the variable nature of the shape of the ionizing
continuum in this source. Previous simultaneous X-ray and optical monitoring
of this source reveals that at some times the X-rays and the He II 4686
emission line nearly disappear, while the UV/optical continuum and Balmer
lines are weaker, but present and continue to vary. This suggests that there
is a variable cutoff in the shape of the ionizing continuum, and in the faint
state this occurs at low enough energies to affect all the strong UV lines. By
comparing emission-line flux ratios in the low state to those in high states
and with photoionization equibrium calculations, we can identify the cutoff
energy. The cutoff energy may correspond to a transition radius in the
accretion disk, inside of which the source has entered into a low-radiative
efficiency mode.

PI:         Denis Grodent

Repeated imaging of Jupiter's aurora has shown that the northern main oval has
a distorted 'kidney bean' shape in the general range of 90-140? System III
longitude, which appears unchanged since 1994. While it is more difficult to
observe the conjugate regions in the southern aurora, no corresponding
distortion appears in the south. Recent improved accuracy in locating the
satellite footprint auroral emissions has provided new information about the
geometry of Jupiter's magnetic field in this and other areas. The study of the
magnetic field provides us with insight into the state of matter and the
dynamics deep down Jupiter. There is currently no other way to do this from
orbit. The persistent pattern of the main oval implies a disturbance of the
local magnetic field, and the increased latitudinal separation of the locus of
satellite footprints from each other and from the main oval implies a locally
weaker field strength. It is possible that these phenomena result from a
magnetic anomaly in Jupiter's intrinsic magnetic field, as was proposed by A.
Dessler in the 1970's. There is presently only limited evidence from the
scarcity of auroral footprints observed in this longitude range. We propose to
obtain HST UV images with specific observing geometries of Jupiter to
determine the locations of the auroral footprints of Io, Europa, and Ganymede
in cycle 13 to accurately determine the magnetic field geometry in the
suggested anomaly region, and to either confirm or refute the suggestion of a

magnesium absorption lines in the soft X-ray photospheric {Chandra} spectrum,
which suggests that H1504+65 may be a O-Ne-Mg white dwarf. We will test this

H1504+65 would be the most compelling case for the existence of single O-Ne-Mg

binaries are currently known with separations exceeding 15 AU. Only 10 dwarfs
in this sample have previous HST observations primarily at optical
wavelengths. With the increased sensitivity of our survey, we will provide the
most stringent test to date of brown dwarf models which envisage formation as
ejected stellar embryos. In addition, our observations will be capable of
detecting binaries with mass ratios as low as 0.3, and will therefore also
test the apparent preference for equal-mass ultracool binaries. Finally, our

will release a 360 kg impactor into the nucleus of the comet on July 4, 2005.
Our primary objective is to study the generation and evolution of the gaseous
coma resulting from this impact. To this end we plan to obtain ultraviolet
spectra with STIS before, during, and following the impact. As a secondary
objective we will obtain wide-band images of the visual outburst resulting
from the impact. We also plan to use the high resolution capability of the
ACS/HRC, in conjunction with the camera on board the spacecraft, two weeks
prior to impact, to determine the spatial orientation of active jets emanating
from the comet's nucleus and to assess the potential hazards of these jets to
the spacecraft.

Title:	    Physical parameters of the upper atmosphere of the extrasolar
	    planet HD209458b
PI:         Alfred Vidal-Madjar

Every 3.5 days, the transits of the gaseous planet orbiting HD209458 offer the
unique opportunity to investigate the spectral features of an extra-solar
planetary atmosphere. Using HST, we first discovered the extended upper
atmosphere of HD209458b through the detection of a 15% HI Lyman alpha
absorption. We concluded that the hydrogen must be escaping the planet with a
lower limit rate of 10^10 g/s {Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003}. Additional
observations, subsequently allowed to detect OI and CII in the upper
atmosphere implying that this atmosphere is hydrodynamically escaping {in
"blow off", Vidal-Madjar et al. 2004}. Here we propose to further study this
upper atmosphere to better constrain the "blow off" state by directly
estimating the physical conditions and the flow characteristics. In particular
we will determine the temperature and density at the base of the upper
atmosphere {the thermosphere}, and the density distribution and ionization
state just below that level. Comparison between the optical and ultraviolet
occultation light curves will provide useful information on the molecular/haze
content of the lower atmosphere. The observation of six HD209458b transits
with HRC and SBC settings will allow the detection of many lines adressing
these issues. The proposed observations will give us for the first time a
detailed probe of the atmosphere of an "evaporating" extra-solar planet.With
species as abundant as FeII or MgII, the damping wings in the strongest lines
will start to form at levels around 1.9% absorption. Due to either the
strength of the MgII doublet lines around 280 nm or the packing of FeII lines,
strong absorptions arising from the accumulated damping wings should show up
clearly in FeII and MgII. All these signatures should be easily detected even
with the 40 to 100 Angstrom resolution of the PR200L prism in these spectral
regions. In addition to these goals, any signature of molecules {e.g CO below
154 nm}, dust or haze should also show up as broad band absorption in both
PR110L and PR200L settings. The estimate of the planet radius at different
wavelengths in the UV would become possible for all efficient absorbers in
this spectral range. The achievement of 0.1% precision in the occultation
curves thus provides sensitivity high enough to potentially lead to important
discoveries.

Title:	    Solving the problem of the White Dwarf Cooling Sequence End in M4:
	    an efficent approach
PI:         Luigi Bedin

The end of the white dwarf {WD} cooling sequence {WDCS} has never been
observed, despite the importance that it has in providing an age estimate of
old stellar systems, independent from the standard method of the main sequence
turn off. The best targets for this investigation are the closest stellar
clusters, and, among them, globular clusters are the most interesting ones.
Being the oldest stellar aggregates, they allow to probe the advanced WD
cooling phases, and the independent age estimate coming from the end of their
WDCS has an important cosmological impact. M4 is the best target for this
investigation. Despite huge observational efforts, we still miss the end of
its WDCS. The ACS camera offers a unique opportunity to identify it. Coupled
with already existing observations, we here prove that we can finally reach it
with only 10 HST orbits. This is probably the last opportunity we have for a
large number of years. The data we are requesting here, will also be used to
complete other two programs of great astrophysical impact: the observational
detection of the main sequence hydrogen burning limit, and the measurement of
the geometrical distance of M4.

Title:	    Detecting the elusive low mass companion around epsilon Indi
PI:         Michael Endl

We propose coronagraphic NICMOS observations of the nearby {d = 3.6 pc} K5V
star epsilon Indi {HD 209100} to search for the unknown companion which causes
a low amplitude radial velocity {RV} trend in our 11 years of precise Doppler
measurements. This RV data set places a lower limit of 4.5 AU for the orbital
semimajor axis of this companion. Moreover, the fact that the RV trend is
lacking any sign of curvature over this long time period clearly points
towards a much larger orbital separation. Epsilon Indi also has a T dwarf
{binary} companion at a separation of 1400 AU. However, these brown dwarf
companions are too distant from the primary to induce the observed RV
variation. It is also unlikely that this nearby star has an unknown stellar {M
dwarf} companion. The RV signal is thus most probably caused by a yet unknown
giant planetary or brown dwarf companion at a separation of more than 5 AU.
Because epsilon Indi is so near to the Sun, it constitutes an ideal target for
high contrast imaging with NICMOS in its coronagraphic mode. Indeed, NICMOS
coronagraphy is capable of detecting objects down to 15 Jupiter masses at
separations greater than 2.3 arcseconds {S/N=25} - precisely the separation
and mass range indicated by our Doppler spectroscopy. Only 2 orbits of
HST/NICMOS observations could directly image the coolest and lowest mass
companion ever found around a solar-type star.

Title:	    The Masses of the Ultraluminous X-Ray Sources
PI:         Joel Bregman

Ultraluminous X-ray sources are non-nuclear sources in normal disk galaxies
that are second only to AGNs in point-source luminosity. These enigmatic
objects are either stellar mass black holes that are super-Eddington emitters,
or sub-Eddington emission from 1E3-1E4 Msolar black holes. We can distinguish
between these models by a direct determination of the mass of the primary,
which requires knowing the spectral type of the secondary, its period, and its
orbital velocity around the black hole. We propose to obtain UV spectra to
determine the spectral type of two ULX secondaries {optical counterparts}, to
infer the masses and radii of the secondaries and their suitability for radial
velocity studies. For another ULX secondary, we already obtained a UV spectrum
showing it to be a B0I star, so we propose three additional observations,
which will yield the characteristic orbital velocity, help constrain the
period, and reveal if the primary is a 1E3-1E4 Msolar black hole, which would
produce velocities > 1000 km/sec.

Title:	    The Coevolution of Supermassive Black Holes and Galaxies at z~3
PI:         Chien Peng

The existence of strong correlations between the mass of supermassive black
holes and galaxy bulge properties implies that there is an intimate connection
between their formation and evolution. How do supermassive black holes grow
and how did the correlations come about? Is the growth of supermassive black
holes coeval with the growth of the bulge, and is a bulge necessary for AGN
activity at high z? We propose to use HST NICMOS to image 9 low-luminosity
broad-line AGNs at z~3 in the restframe B-band, identified through the
Lyman-break technique. This sample is unique because the AGN luminosities are
comparable to Seyfert-like nuclei at z~3, and thus are some of the lowest that
have been selected optically. Because of the low total luminosity of the
sample, the hosts are likely to be Lyman-break galaxies, which are believed to
be the progenitor galaxies of the local Hubble sequence. The goal is to
directly detect their host galaxies and to separate the AGN, in order to study
the host galaxy morphology and luminosity. From measurement of the bulge
luminosity and black hole mass {through available spectra}, we will study the
black hole-bulge coevolution out to z~3. We will also compare the luminosity
and morphology of these faint AGN hosts with the more luminous and massive
host galaxies found in previous HST studies of quasars.

Title:	    NICMOS observations of A1689
PI:         Narciso Benitez

The potential of galaxy clusters as ``cosmic telescopes'' has been known for a
long time, but practical results in the pre-ACS era have been scarce due to
two main problems: the uncertainty in determining the magnification
distribution of the cluster {the ``optics'' of the instrument} and the
presence of numerous bright cluster galaxies which cover the field of view and
hinder the detection of background galaxies. We have developed techniques to
solve these two problems working with our ACS observations of A1689, the most
powerful lens in the sky, and for the first time we have been able to
determine the "specifications" of a cosmic telescope with a useful level of
precision, thanks to the detection and identification of more than 100
multiple images with reliable redshift information. We propose to observe the
high magnification region in the A1689 field in the F110W band with a 3x3
mosaic of NIC3 pointings; the resulting image will reach a lens-corrected
limiting magnitudes of 29.5 for point sources, surpassing in depth the UDF
NICMOS observations and providing an unique dataset with multiple scientific
returns.

Title:	    Testing the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium Paradigm
PI:         Jay Howk

Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations predict that ~30%-40% of the
low-redshift baryons reside in a collisionally ionized phase {log T ~ 5 to 7}
of the intergalactic medium {IGM} associated with large-scale, unvirialized
filaments of galaxies. Recent surveys of O VI gas have lent some support to
the presence of this warm-hot intergalactic medium {WHIM}, but the results are
significantly limited by uncertainties in the ionization mechanism {photo- vs.
collisionally ionized} and metallicity of the gas. We are pursuing a large
program to test predictions of the WHIM and to improve existing measurements
of the OVI absorbers. The primary goals are {i} to increase the redshift path
for detection of the hottest IGM, previously only accessible through X-ray
absorption studies, using EUV absorption from Ne VIII and Mg X, and {ii} to
constrain the IGM physics using UV absorption from H I Ly-alpha, C III, C IV,
and O VI. Our team has been awarded a FUSE Legacy program to probe the
moderate-redshift WHIM using unique ionization diagnostics in the restframe
EUV waveband, including O V, Ne VIII and Mg X. Here we propose to complement
our FUSE Legacy program with STIS intermediate-resolution echelle-mode
observations of five moderate-redshift {0.45 < z < 0.98} AGNs. The unique
combination of FUSE EUV and STIS UV spectra will allow us {1} to test the
current models of the WHIM by studying the ionization mechanisms responsible
for producing highly-ionized metals in the IGM and determining the frequency
of genuine high-temperature metal absorbers in the low-redshift IGM; {2} to
investigate the relationship between WHIM and large-scale galaxy structures
using galaxy redshift measurements obtained with DEIMOS on Keck and IMACS at
Las Campanas Observatory; and {3} to determine the ionization state and
metallicity of O VI absorbers in order to accurately assess their contribution
to the total baryon budget. Finally, we will make high-level science products

census of the the morphology of cluster galaxies in the cores of clusters, to
detect radial and tangential arc candidates, to detect optical jet candidates,
and to provide an approximate estimate of the shear signal of the clusters
themselves, and potentially an assessment of the contribution of large scale

Title:	    Multi-wavelength Observations of Symbiotic Stars in Outburst
PI:         Charles Keyes

To investigate the cause and nature of classical symbiotic outbursts, we
initiated a program of multi-wavelength observations of these events. As
evidence is mounting that collimated outflows {jets} may be associated with
symbiotic outbursts, we also investigate conditions needed for jet production
- a question with broad astrophysical relevance. The first target for our
campaign - the 2000-2002 outburst of Z Andromedae - confirmed the utility and
need for coordinated multi-wavelength observations to make progress in
understanding the nature of the outburst mechanisms in symbiotic stars. FUSE
data were the cornerstone of that project {which included data from the VLA,
MERLIN, ground-based spectroscopy and photometry, Chandra, and XMM, but not
HST}. Our Z And observations have motivated us to propose a new scenario that
we term the "combination nova" which is triggered by a disk-instability. To
test this new model, we received HST Cycle 12 and FUSE Cycle 4 time {through
approximately 6/2004} to continue the multi-wavelength approach with
observations at several epochs during the outburst of a second
target-of-opportunity {TOO}. That TOO has not yet been triggered. We propose
here to continue this TOO observing opportunity into Cycle 13 {to 7/2005}.
FUSE Cycle 5 observations {to mid-2005} were recently approved. Coordinated
XMM and VLA observations are also approved. The evolution of the UV spectrum
throughout the outburst plays a vital role in distinguishing between the
outburst models currently in contention for describing outburst behavior.
Analysis of our first campaign has shown that HST observations can play a
fundamental role in the multi-wavelength approach. The combination of
high-resolution STIS and FUSE-band emission and absorption features,
time-tagged observations, and continua provide a unique opportunity to probe
the structure and ionization conditions in the outburst material that can not
be accomplished with either ultraviolet region alone.

morphological confirmation of galaxy candidates lying near critical lines, and
{2} the determination of the physical scales involved in star-forming regions

Title:	    A Mini-Survey of Interstellar Abundances in the Magellanic Clouds
PI:         Daniel Welty

Studies of the interstellar medium in the Magellanic Clouds explore somewhat
different environmental conditions from those typically probed in our own
Galactic ISM. Apart from a few studies of individual sightlines, however,
little is known about the abundances and depletions in the ISM of the LMC and
SMC. HST spectra of three SMC stars indicate that Si and Mg {generally thought
to be major dust constituents} are essentially undepleted in the SMC gas ---
even for components with severe depletions of Fe and Ni. Similar "anomalous"
Si depletions have now been seen in cycle 12 STIS spectra of one LMC star,
though "normal" Si depletions are seen toward a second. Intriguingly, the
"anomalous" Si depletions are all found for sightlines which probe regions
where the 2175 A extinction bump is either absent {most of SMC} or very weak
{LMC2}. We therefore propose a mini-survey of interstellar absorption lines
toward 13 stars distributed throughout the LMC and SMC --- which would more
than double the number of Magellanic Clouds sightlines with extensive and
accurate interstellar abundance information. A single STIS E230M setting will
include lines from Zn II, Si II, Fe II, Ti II, Cr II, Ni II, and several trace
neutral species --- allowing the abundance/depletion pattern to be determined
at many locations in the two galaxies. The analysis of these spectra will have
significant implications for {1} making models of interstellar dust grains
{which currently rely heavily on silicates}; {2} understanding the
relationships between depletions, dust, and H_2 {which may be somewhat
different in the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC}; and {3} interpreting the gas-phase
abundances observed for more distant low-metallicity systems, such as the QSO
absorption-line systems {which exhibit some similar properties}.

Title:	    Saturn's Auroral Energy Deposition Coordinated with Cassini UVIS

An in-depth study of Saturn's magnetosphere and auroral processes has begun in
Jan. 2004 with coordinated HST STIS images of Saturn's aurora while the
approaching Cassini measures the solar wind. This program is expected to
establish the degree of solar wind control of Saturn's aurora. The beginning
of the Cassini orbiter tour of the Saturn system in July 2004 will offer new
opportunities for collaborative science. The energetics of Saturn's auroral
processes can best be studied via low resolution UV spectra of the emissions
and the auroral "color ratio". The geometry of the initial Cassini orbits
provides the best observing geometry for UVIS measurements of auroral
energetics when it is close to Saturn on the night side. At such times, it
will be possible to have simultaneous observations of Saturn's southern /
dayside aurora with HST STIS and the northern / nightside aurora with Cassini
UVIS. Both the distributions of the auroral emissions and the energy of the
precipitating particles can be measured simultaneously at conjugate points
north and south. This proposal is to conduct one such simultaneous
observation, which will demonstrate the potential for future cycles. We
request 5 HST orbits to observe a large fraction of one complete Saturn
rotation at the same time as Cassini UVIS. The rotational coverage has been
shown to be of central importance in recent STIS images of Saturn's auroral
activity, which is concentrated in an "active sector" connected with the
strongest SKR radio emissions.

Title:	    Bulges or disks in the centers of late-type spirals?
PI:         Marcella Carollo

In a simple view of the Hubble sequence, smaller bulges should be rescaled
versions of bigger bulges. Bulges however have been found to change their
structural properties with decreasing luminosity, approaching at the faintest
end a disk-like, exponential light profile. This indicates a complex
mass-dependent bulge formation history. Particularly, the
intermediate-to-small size bulges have been suggested to form due to secular
evolution processes within their host disks. However, the alleged small bulges
may even be 'simply' denser inner regions of the disks. Two major ingredients
are missing in order to {a} understand the nature of bulges in the
disk-dominated galaxies, {b} establish whether and which secular evolution
processes actually occur, and {c} in which mass range they are preferentially
active: {1} High-resolution numerical simulations of disk secular evolution,
to provide a quantitative basis for interpreting real data; {2} Observational
diagnostics which can break the degeneracy between very cold, dense disks and
relatively hot bulges, and to compare with the simulations. We are carrying
out a large N-body + SPH simulations campaign to settle the first issue.
Stellar kinematics are the ideal observational diagnostics. We have acquired
ground kinematic data for the medium-sized bulges. However, both the
spectroscopic and the spatial resolution requirements necessary to trace the
relative contributions of cold and hot motions become very stringent at the
faint-end of the bulge sequence: only the HST can provide radially-extended
kinematics for the smallest bulges. We therefore ask for STIS/G750M
spectroscopy to measure internal resolved stellar kinematics for two small
bulges selected from our previous HST imaging program. Even just these two
"data-points" in this unexplored mass-regime will allow significant progress
in the understanding of the origin of the Hubble sequence: Complemented by our
ground-study of the medium-sized bulges, they will allow us to establish
whether the ratio of cold-to-hot motions in bulges in the
intermediate-to-small mass regime depends on the bulge mass, and, by comparing
with our simulations, to constrain the initial conditions and physical
parameters that allow disk secular evolution processes to grow central bulges
similar to those that are observed along the entire Hubble sequence.

We request time to obtain ACS deep images of the B1608+656 gravitational lens
system to fully characterize its enclosing Einstein ring with high
signal-to-noise ratio {SNR}. These data will allow us to determine the
gravitational potential of the lens, locally, to several percent accuracy and,
combined with the three independent time delays, measure H_0 to much better
than 10% precision. For this goal, we have developed powerful new lens
modeling codes that make use of the full brightness distribution of the
Einstein ring in lens systems. The B1608+656 system is ideal for our new code.
It has precisely measured time delays, a well-determined stellar velocity
dispersion, and an Einstein ring that is not dominated by the lensed nuclear
emission of the background source. When combined with high-SNR images of
Einstein rings, the new modeling codes provide qualitatively different and
much improved analysis of the ring emission than was previously possible. The
proposed ACS observations will reach the SNR at which the new modeling code
can be fully exploited {SNR=5 per pixel}. Our simulations show that these new
data will allow us to reduce the total uncertainties in H_0 derived from the
system by at least a factor of two, to the 5-7% level for this system.

Our group has demonstrated the role that massive clusters of galaxies, acting
as powerful cosmic lenses, can play in locating sources with modest mass and
star formation rate beyond redshifts z~5-6 likely to be representative of
those responsible for cosmic reionization. The large magnifications, possible
in the critical regions of well-constrained clusters, bring sources into view
that would lie at or beyond the limits of conventional exposures such as the
UDF. Recently, using deep ACS and NICMOS imaging, we have located a low mass
source at z=7.05 whose UV continuum slope is apparently steeper than for
normal star-forming galaxies. We propose a deep ACS grism exposure to confirm
the nature of this source and further ACS and NICMOS imaging of well-studied
clusters to locate further examples. The grism spectroscopy will conclusively
determine the UV SED of this source and our 3-color survey will constrain the
redshift, star-formation rate, and SED of additional 6<z<8 sources. Over the
strongly-lensed {unlensed} area of 2.5 arcmin^2, we expect to detect 10 more
sources at z>6.5, with more than 2.5 Msun/yr of star formation {our survey
limit}. Before the advent of the next generation of observational facilities,
our search technique may represent the only way to reliably select and
characterize the likely population of galaxies during the epoch of

model for Seyfert nuclei which includes a compact, equatorial scattering
region located within the circum-nuclear torus and the 'classic' polar

The proposed multi-band imaging of one of the most dynamic regions on Jupiter

constraints to models of Jovian atmospheric dynamics. NICMOS is sensitive to
the jovian troposphere at and above the visible cloud decks. We selected six
NICMOS filters with varying levels of atmospheric opacity to observe cloud
features as they rotate from the central meridian to the limb, a strategy that
will maximize the vertical resolution of our retrievals of cloud heights, haze
opacity, and gaseous ammonia concentration. With these filters and the
excellent NICMOS spatial resolution {nearly an order of magnitude improvement
over Galileo NIMS images of the northern equatorial region}, we will determine
the smaller-scale structure of fresh NH3 clouds and provide cloud heights as
constraints for models of convection and dynamics associated with 5-micron
hotspots. HST is essential for this project, since no other observatory can
provide the necessary spatial resolution, and no ground-based or space-based

Heat conduction is one of the most fundamental processes in the interstellar

in contact with hot {10^6 -10^8 K} gas; at the contact surfaces, heat
conduction occurs and may play an essential role in the thermal structure and
evolution of the system. Observations of thermal conduction fronts have been
extremely limited. Conventionally observations use absorption lines of
collisionally ionized high ions as tracers of 1-3x10^5 K gas in the conduction
front. Such observations allow the determination of column densities but not
the relative locations of these tracer ions. Emission-line observations of a
clear-cut, edge-on conduction front are needed to study the physical structure
of a thermal conduction front. We have identified a clean-cut, edge-on
conduction front in the circumstellar bubble S308, using XMM-Newton X-ray
observations and ground-based optical images and spectra. We request HST STIS
spectroscopic observations of the NV and CVI emission lines in the transition
region from the hot interior gas to the cool nebular shell. These
observations, combined with our complementary observations at optical, FUV,
and X-ray wavelength, allow us to determine the spatially-resolved temperature
profile of a thermal conduction front. Comparisons with models further allow

NGC 3603 is the most massive, visible giant HII region in our Galaxy and
virtually a clone of R136, the famous supercluster in the core of the 30 Dor
region in the LMC. NGC 3603 harbors three young, extremely luminous, hot stars
which mimic the spectral appearance of WN6ha stars. As tailored atmosphere
analysis reveals, these stars are unevolved, very massive stars on the main
sequence. In fact, these stars have the potential of being the most massive
main sequence stars known in our Galaxy. One of these WN6ha stars is a
double-eclipsing binary with a 3.7724d period. We propose here to use HST/STIS
to carry out, for the first time, repeated, high-quality spectroscopy of this
binary in order to derive Keplerian orbits for both components and thus
directly measure their masses. Additional photometry will considerably refine
the solution for the inclination angle. Whether or not the mass of the WN6ha
{and possibly also its companion} star significantly exceeds 60 M_sol, the
current directly-observed, upper limit of main sequence stars, will allow us
to put models for massive stars to the test. As a by-product of our
observations, we will also monitor the two remaining WN6ha stars in NGC 3603.
At least one of them shows strong indications for binarity.

Title:	    HD 62542: Probing the Bare, Dense Core of an Interstellar Cloud
PI:         Daniel Welty

The line of sight to HD 62542 is remarkable for its unusual UV extinction,
high column densities of various molecules, and apparent dearth of diffuse
atomic gas. The main interstellar cloud appears to be a small, dense {n_H ~
500--1000 cm^-3}, molecular knot whose more diffuse outer layers have been
stripped away by stellar winds and shocks. As such, it provides an ideal venue
for investigating the properties of dense, molecular gas --- with minimal
confusion from any associated diffuse gas. We propose to obtain high
resolution, moderately high S/N STIS spectra of C I, CO and its isotopomers,
C_2, C II, O I, and many other atomic species. Those data will be used to
compare various diagnostics of the physical conditions {e.g., C I and O I fine
structure excitation, CO and C_2 rotational excitation}, to determine the
relative abundances of the various CO isotopomers {fractionation}, and to
determine the depletions of various elements in dense gas {the predicted
severe depletions have likely been masked by associated diffuse gas in other
cases}. Understanding the fractionation and excitation of CO in this
relatively simple case will aid in understanding its behavior in other more
complex regions {important because CO and its isotopomers are often used to
trace and characterize molecular gas when H_2 cannot be measured}.

Title:	    Determination of orbits and colors for two new binaries in the

PI:         William Merline

We propose to measure color and orbital properties of two asteroid binaries in
the Koronis family discovered in our SNAP-9747 survey. The best previously
studied asteroid binary system, Ida/Dactyl, is also in the Koronis family.
Differential space weathering measured on the Ida and Dactyl surfaces has been
a powerful constraint on models of satellite formation mechanisms and
satellite survivability. HST offers the unique opportunity for similar
measurements of these much smaller, main-belt binaries. The new satellites are
believed to have formed through different collisional mechanisms than
Ida/Dactyl. Further, with a set of 4 relative position measurements for each
of the two systems, added to the discovery snapshots, we will determine and
compare the densities of the primaries with Ida {a large, 31.5 km, asteroid
with density 2.6+-0.5 g/cm^3, measured by the Galileo flyby}. In contrast,
{17246} and {22899} are 4.5 km bodies that are likely to have been
restructured since the family-forming event by subsequent collisions. As all
are members of the same family, differences in density would constrain bulk
composition and internal structure {e.g. shard vs. rubble-pile}. Hence, these
measurements are likely to further elucidate the mechanisms for formation of
satellites.

orbiting other stars.  The field is a twelve by twelve degree square in
Cygnus.  It abuts the GE.  The detection technique is to search
photometrically for planetary transits.  Faint eclipsing binaries that are not
spatially resolved from the target star by Kepler may cause confusion, leading
to false positive detections.  The HST is uniquely capable of determining the
potential magnitude of the issue in the region of the GE, where stellar

Title:	    Imaging of Ices in Circumstellar Disks
PI:         Alycia Weinberger

The link between the material of the interstellar medium and the ultimate
composition of planets lies in the way gas and dust are processed in
circumstellar disks. Planet formation models rely upon a knowledge of the disk
constituents and temperature profiles to simulate how small grains eventually
combine into terrestrial planets and gas giant cores. Disks around other stars
may be analogs for our own early Solar System and thus allow the direct
measurement of such phenomena. Only recently, however, have well-resolved
images of dust disks around several late T Tauri or main sequence stars been
secured. HST provides a uniquely stable platform for making such sensitive
high dynamic range images. Now, for those handful of disks already resolved,
we are able to go beyond the discovery phase and begin making astrophysical
measurements to deepen our understanding of the course of disk evolution. We
therefore propose a multi-wavelength study with NICMOS designed to discover
the spatial distribution of two common Solar System materials -- methane and
water ices -- in other systems.

HST's high-contrast capabilities provide exciting imaging of circumstellar
debris disks with complex structures. In particular, broad-band imaging using
the coronagraphs in NICMOS and STIS has elucidated the disk morphology of HR
4796A exquisitely, but can only provide colors, not detailed compositional
information on its dust. With spectra, we will measure the detailed albedo of
the disk dust over a large wavelength range and search for interstellar
medium-like molecules and water ice. We will also use our spatially resolved
spectra for very high angular resolution profiles of the disk width to
constrain models for planets circling inside the dust. We have demonstrated in
a previous program how to use STIS for spatially resolved disk spectroscopy.
We now propose to use our technique to study HR 4796A.

PI:         Almudena Alonso-Herrero

Luminous Infrared Galaxies {LIRGs, LIR = 10^11-10^12Lsol} and Ultraluminous
Infrared Galaxies {LIR>10^12Lsol} account for approximately 75% of all the
galaxies detected in the mid-infrared in the redshift range z=0-1.5. In the
local universe it is found that LIRGs are predominantly powered by intense
star formation {SF}. However, the physical conditions and processes governing
such dramatic activity over scales of tens to a few hundred parsecs are poorly
known. In the last decade HST has been playing a significant role, mainly with
the discovery of super star cluters {SSCs}, and more recently, giant HII
regions. Based on observations of a few LIRGs, we found that these giant HII
regions and associated SSCs appear to be more common in LIRGs than in normal
galaxies, and may dominate the star formation activity in LIRGs. A larger
sample is required to address fundamental questions. We propose an HST/NICMOS
targeted campaign of a volume limited sample {v<5200km/s} of 24 LIRGs. This
proposal will probe the role of giant HII regions in the overall energetics of
the current star formation, their relation to SSCs, and the dependence of star
formation properties on other parameters of LIRGs. Such detailed knowledge of
the SF properties of LIRGs in the local universe is essential for
understanding galaxies at high redshift.

We propose Snapshot observations of Uranus and Neptune to monitor changes in

rapidly approaching equinox in 2007, with another 4 degrees of latitude
becoming visible every year. Recent HST observations during this epoch
{including 6818: Hammel, Lockwood, and Rages; 7885: Hammel, Karkoschka, and
Marley; 8680: Hammel, Rages, Lockwood, and Marley; and 8634: Rages, Hammel,
Lockwood, Marley, and McKay} have revealed strongly wavelength-dependent
latitudinal structure and the presence of numerous visible-wavelength cloud
features in the northern hemisphere. Long-term ground-based observations
{Lockwood and Thompson 1999} show seasonal brightness changes whose origins
are not well understood. Recent near-IR images of Neptune obtained using
adaptive optics on the Keck Telesccope together with images from our Cycle 9
Snapshot program {8634} show a general increase in activity at south temperate
latitudes as well as the possible development of another Great Dark Spot.
Further Snapshot observations of these two dynamic planets will elucidate the
nature of long-term changes in their zonal atmospheric bands and clarify the
processes of formation, evolution, and dissipation of discrete albedo
features.

PI:         George Pavlov

PSR J0437-4715 is the nearest and the brightest millisecond {recycled} pulsar,
and the only one detected at near-optical wavelengths. We detected it with the
HST STIS/FUV-MAMA detector and found that its FUV spectrum is consistent with
being emitted from the neutron star surface with a temperature of about 0.1
MK, surprisingly high for such an old object. We also found evidence of an
emission line at 1372 A, tentatively interpreted as a Zeeman component of the
hydrogen Ly-alpha line in a magnetic field of 700 MG. Unfortunately, the
spectrum was imaged in a region of strong detector background, which strongly
hampered the spectral and timing analyses. We propose to re-observe the pulsar
with the FUV-MAMA, placing the target in a low-background region, and also
observe it with the NUV-MAMA to obtain the spectrum and pulsations in a broad
UV range. The spectral analysis will allow us to measure the temperature of
the full neutron star surface and test the origin of the heating of old
neutron stars. Confirmation of the spectral line would lead to a first direct
measuremnt of the magnetic field and radius of a spin-powered neutron star and
uniquely constrain the equation of state of superdense matter. The NUV
spectrum and pulsations will also probe the magnetospheric emission and the
thermal structure of the cool white dwarf companion.

PI:         Richard de Grijs

Recent ground-based observations have revealed that the highly reddened
Galactic cluster Westerlund 1 is the current best and by far the nearest
"Young Massive Star Cluster" {YSC} candidate, i.e. a young {< 10 Myr}, dense
and massive {> 10, 000 Mo} object of which until recently 30 Doradus in the
LMC was believed to be the nearest example. However, extrapolations of the
locally derived cluster luminosity function indicate that perhaps up to a
hundred similar objects should exist within the Galaxy. The close-up view of a
YSC provided by Westerlund 1 allows us to obtain an unprecedented glimpse of
the process of massive cluster formation, evolution and fate, which are among
the very key issues in modern astrophysics. Utilising deep ACS and NICMOS
imaging and sophisticated N-body and Monte Carlo simulations, we will address
key questions regarding Westerlund 1's nature, formation and dynamical
evolution. These include, What are the initial conditions with which
Westerlund 1 was born? To what degree was mass segregation really primordial?
Has the binary fraction changed during the short cluster lifetime? Do we
expect the cluster to have a population of stellar-mass black holes? Does the
cluster harbour an intermediate-mass black hole in its core? Is Westerlund 1
unique as a Galactic YSC? How similar is the cluster to the massive "Arches"
and "Quintuplet" Galactic Centre clusters, and to 30 Doradus? With an expected
life-span of > 100 Myr, it is conceivable that there should be more YSCs like
Westerlund 1 in the Galactic disk. Our dynamical simulations will help us
determine the ultimate fate of such clusters, allowing us to at least begin to
answer the question of Westerlund 1's uniqueness in the context of the
Galaxy's stellar populations.

Radio galaxies are an important class of extragalactic objects: they are one
of the most energetic astrophysical phenomena and they provide an exceptional
probe of the evolving Universe, lying typically in high density regions but
well-represented across a wide redshift range. In earlier Cycles we carried
out extensive HST observations of the 3CR sources in order to acquire a
complete and quantitative inventory of the structure, contents and evolution
of these important objects. Amongst the results, we discovered new optical
jets, dust lanes, face-on disks with optical jets, and revealed point-like
nuclei whose properties support FR-I/BL Lac unified schemes. Here, we propose
to obtain NICMOS infrared images of 3CR sources with z<0.3 as a major
enhancement to an already superb dataset. We aim to deshroud dusty galaxies,
study the underlying host galaxy free from the distorting effects of dust,
locate hidden regions of star formation and establish the physical
characteristics of the dust itself. We will measure frequency and spectral
energy distributions of point-like nuclei, expected to be stronger and more
prevelant in the IR, seek spectral turnovers in known synchrotron jets and
find new jets. We will strongly test unified AGN schemes and merge these data
with existing X-ray to radio observations. The resulting database will be an
incredibly valuable resource to the astronomical community for years to come.

PI:         Leon Koopmans

Gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics provide two complementary methods
to determine the mass distribution and evolution of luminous and dark-matter
in early-type {E/S0} galaxies. The combined study of stellar dynamics and
gravitational lensing allows one to break degeneracies inherent to each method
separately, providing a clean probe of the internal structure of massive
galaxies. Since most lens galaxies are at redshifts z=0.1-1.0, they also
provide the required look-back time to study their structural and
stellar-population evolution. We recently analyzed 5 E/S0 lens galaxies
between z=0.5 and 1.0, combining exquisite Hubble Space Telescope imaging data
with kinematic data from ground-based Keck spectroscopy, placing the first
precise constraints on the dark-matter mass fraction and its inner slope
beyond the local Universe. To expand the sample to ~30 systems -- required to
study potential trends and evolution in the E/S0 mass profiles -- we propose
to target the 49 E/S0 lens-galaxy candidates discovered by Bolton et al.
{2004} from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey {SDSS}. With the average lens rate
being 40% and some systems having a lensing probability close to unity, we
expect to discover ~20 strong gravitational lenses from the sample. This will
triple the current sample of 9 E/S0 systems, with data in hand. With the
sample of 30 systems, we will be able to determine the average slope of the
dark-matter and total mass profile of E/S0 galaxies to 10% and 4% accuracy,
respectively. If present, we can simultaneously detect 10% evolution in the
total mass slope with 95% confidence. This will provide unprecedented
constraints on E/S0 galaxies beyond the local Universe and allow a stringent
test of their formation scenarios and the standard cosmological model.

Title:	    STIS Snapshot Survey of Boron Abundances in Early-B Stars
PI:         Charles Proffitt

Boron abundances in massive stars provide a unique constraint for new
theoretical models of stellar evolution that include rotation. We propose to
use STIS to measure the B III doublet near 2066 Angstroms in a large sample of
early-B stars. A high priority will be placed on obtaining abundances for
several stars in each of a number of different young clusters, assocations,
and star forming regions. This will allow quantitative comparision with
theoretical predictions of rotationally driven mixing in early B stars as
function of mass, age, and rotation rate. Since boron abundance measurements
are not possible for large vsin{i} values, and sin{i} is not known for
individual stars, a large sample is required to statistically test the
predictions of boron depletion as a function of the true rotation rate. For
bright nearby stars {25 targets} we will use the G230MB grating and obtain
very high S/N {>200:1}. This avoids the need for an ND filter which would
discard 99% of the photons. Spectral synthesis techniques will allow us to
derive accurate abundances despite the moderate resolution of this grating,
even for stars with relatively high vsin{i} values. This is especially
important in testing rotational models, as current abundance measurements are
mostly for stars with much lower than average rotation rates. For fainter,
more distant stars {27 targets} we will use the E230M or E230H grating with
the 0.2x0.2 aperture.

A systematic imaging search for extra-solar Jovian planets is now possible
thanks to recent progress in identifying "young stars near Earth". For most of
the proposed young {<~ 30 Myrs} and nearby {<~ 60 pc} targets, we can detect a
few Jupiter-mass planets as close as a few tens of AUs from the primary stars.
This represents the first time that potential analogs of our solar system -
that is planetary systems with giant planets having semi-major axes comparable
to those of the four giant planets of the Solar System - come within the grasp
of existing instrumentation. Our proposed targets have not been observed for
planets with the Hubble Space Telescope previously. Considering the very
successful earlier NICMOS observations of low mass brown dwarfs and planetary
disks among members of the TW Hydrae Association, a fair fraction of our
targets should also turn out to posses low mass brown dwarfs, giant planets,
or dusty planetary disks because our targets are similar to {or even better
than} the TW Hydrae stars in terms of youth and proximity to Earth. Due to the
recent cancellation of SM4, HST will inevitably degrade into a 2-gyro mode
soon and high contrast survey programs like our own cannot be carried out with
two gyros. This means that the HST cycle 13 may be the last chance to find
young Solar System analogs in the coming decade. Should HST time be awarded

PI:         Glenn Schneider

Until recently, despite decades of concerted effort applied to understanding
the formation processes that gave birth to our solar system, the detailed
morphology of circumstellar material that must eventually form planets has
been virtually impossible to discern. The advent of high contrast,
coronagraphic imaging as implemented with the instruments aboard HST has
dramatically enhanced our understanding of natal planetary system formation.
Even so, only a handful of evolved disks {~ 1 Myr and older} have been imaged
and spatially resolved in light scattered from their constituent grains. To
elucidate the physical processes and properties in potentially planet-forming
circumstellar disks, and to understand the nature and evolution of their
grains, a larger spatially resolved and photometrically reliable sample of
such systems must be observed. Thus, we propose a highly sensitive
circumstellar disk imaging survey of a well-defined and carefully selected
sample of YSOs {1-10 Myr T Tau and HAeBe stars} and {> app 10 Myr} main
sequence stars, to probe the posited epoch of planetary system formation, and
to provide this critically needed imagery. Our resolved images will shed light
on the spatial distributions of the dust in these thermally emissive disks. In
combination with their long wavelength SEDs the physical properties of the
grains will be discerned, or constrained by our photometrically accurate
surface brightness sensitivity limits for faint disks which elude detection.
Our sample builds on the success of the exploratory GTO 7233 program, using
two-roll per orbit PSF-subtracted NICMOS coronagraphy to provide the highest
detection sensitivity to the smallest disks around bright stars which can be
imaged with HST. Our sample will discriminate between proposed evolutionary
scenarios while providing a legacy of cataloged morphologies for interpreting
mid- and far-IR SEDs that the recently launched Spitzer Space Telescope will
deliver. This project cannot be done from the ground, and becomes untenable
for HST after Cycle 13 under the anticipated use of two-gyro pointing control

PI:         Dean Hines

The formation of planetary systems is intimately linked to the dust population
in circumstellar disks, thus understanding dust grain evolution is essential
to advancing our understanding of how planets form. By combining {1} the high
resolution polarimetric capabilities of ACS and NICMOS, {2} powerful 3-D
radiative transfer codes, and {3} observations of objects known to span the
earliest stellar evolutionary phases, we will gain crucial insight into the
initial phases of dust grain growth: evolution away from an ISM distribution.
Fractional polarization is a strong function of wavelength, therefore by
comparing polarimetric images in the optical and infrared, we can sensitively
constrain not only the geometry and optical depth of the scattering medium,
but also the grain size distribution. By observing objects representative of
the earliest evolutionary sequence of YSOs, we will be able to investigate how
the dust population evolves in size and distribution during the crucial
transition from a disk+envelope system to a disk+star system. The proposed
study will help to establish the fundamental time scales for the initial
depletion of ISM-like grains: the first step in understanding the
transformation from small submicron sized dust grains, to large millimeter
sized grains, and untimely to planetary bodies.

The massive black hole Sgr A* at the Galactic center has recently shown not
only quiescent emission at near-IR wavelengths, but also flare activity with
quasi-periodicity of 17 minutes. Our research group has been granted two
blocks of observing time with XMM-Newton to monitor the spectral and temporal
properties of Sgr A*. Simultaneously with these X-ray observations, we will
also monitor Sgr A* at radio, submillimeter, near-IR, and gamma-ray
wavelengths. We propose to use NICMOS in parallel with the XMM observations to
provide evidence of a well-defined minimum periodicity in the spectrum of
flare periodicities. This, combined with periodicity in the near-IR line
emission, would strengthen the claim that the emitting gas resides at the
innermost stable circular orbit around the GC black hole, thus measuring the
spin parameter of a massive black hole. Current groundbased near-IR data
suggest a spin parameter of ~0.5. In addition, the correlation pattern of
emission over a wide spectrum would elucidate a key issue of how to explain
the low luminosity of Sgr A*. The NICMOS on HST is the only instrument that
can accurately measure the 17 minute quasi-periodic variability of Sgr A*
because of the long time baseline over which HST can observe Sgr A* in
parallel with XMM-Newton.

Recent observations suggest that very low-mass galaxies in the local universe
are still in the process of formation. To investigate this issue we propose to
obtain deep ACS HRC images in the U, V and I bands of a sample of 11
"ultracompact" blue dwarf galaxies {UCBDs} identified in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. These objects are nearby {z < 0.009}, actively star-forming, and have
extremely small angular and physical sizes {d < 6" and D < 1 kpc}. They also
tend to reside in voids. Our WFPC2 images of the prototype object of this
class, POX 186, reveal this tiny object to have a highly disturbed morphlogy
indicative of a recent {within 10^8 yr} collision between two small {~ 100 pc}
clumps of stars that could represent the long-sought building blocks predicted
by the Press-Schechter model of hierarchical galaxy formation. This collision
has also triggered the formation of a "super" star cluster {SSC} at the
object's core that may be the progenitor of a globular cluster. POX 186 thus
appears to be a very small dwarf galaxy in the process of formation. This
exciting discovery strongly motivates HST imaging of a full sample of UCBDs in
order to determine if they have morphologies similar to POX 186. HST images
are essential for resolving the structure of these objects, including
establishing the presence of SSCs. HST also offers the only way to determine
their morphologies in the near UV. The spectra of the objects available from
the SDSS will also allow us to measure their star formation rates, dust
content and metallicities. In addition to potentially providing the first
direct evidence of Press-Schechter building blocks, these data could yield
insight into the relationship between galaxy and globular cluster formation,
and will serve as a test of the recent "downsizing" model of galaxy formation
in which the least massive objects are the last to form.

The recent surprising discovery of six unusually bright {r~20 mag} Lyman break
galaxy {LBG} candidates with z=2.45-2.80 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
{SDSS} raises a number of questions that only HST can address. Specifically,
what is the true nature of these objects, and what role if any is played by
gravitational lensing? We propose to use the superior resolution and
sensitivity of ACS and NICMOS to obtain deep images of these objects and their
environments. Compared to SDSS images, HST will allow us to determine their
morphologies {extended, point-source, or lensed}, the appearance of their
environments {rich or poor}, and to detect any faint foreground groups or
clusters that might be responsible for lensing these objects. All outcomes
would be intruiging. If the objects are lensed, it increases from 1
{MS1512-cB58} to 7 the number of normal LBGs bright enough to study
individually. If they are instead unlensed point sources, they will represent
a new class of previously unidentified absorption-line quasars. Finally, if
they are unlensed and extended star-forming galaxies, they are at least 4mag
brighter than L_* LBGs, thus making them the most luminous star-forming
objects yet seen, representing a heretofore unknown extreme population of

such as cosmic chemical evolution. At present, the progenitors of SNe Ia and
the exact explosion mechanisms are still poorly understood, as are
evolutionary effects on SN Ia peak luminosities. Since early-time UV spectra
and light curves of nearby SNe Ia can directly address these questions, we
propose an approach consisting of two observational components: {1} Detailed
studies of two very bright, young, nearby SNe Ia with HST UV spectroscopy at
13 epochs within the first 1.5 months after discovery; and {2} studies of
correlations with luminosity for five somewhat more distant Hubble-flow SNe
Ia, for which relative luminosities can be determined with precision, using 8
epochs of HST UV spectroscopy and/or broad-band imaging. The HST data, along
with extensive ground-based optical to near-IR observations, will be analyzed
with state-of-the-art models to probe SN Ia explosion physics and constrain
the nature of the progenitors. The results will form the basis for the next
phase of precision cosmology measurements using SNe Ia, allowing us to more
fully capitalize on the substantial past {and future} investments of time made
with HST in observations of high-redshift SNe Ia.

Title:	    A Deep Far-UV Search for the Interacting Binary Population in M80
PI:         Christian Knigge

We propose to carry out a deep, far-ultraviolet {FUV}, time-resolved survey
for cataclysmic variables {CVs} and other dynamically-formed objects in the
globular cluster {GC} M80. This will include a search for FUV counterparts to
the 17 Chandra sources in our field of view, which include 2 LMXBs and 5 X-ray
selected CV candidates. Our goal is to confirm these sources as interacting
binaries and find any additional CVs below the Chandra detection limit. We
will achieve this with 6 orbits of FUV imaging with the ACS/SB, plus one
additional orbit of NUV imaging with ACS/HRC. Since crowding is not a problem
in the FUV, this will yield time-resolved FUV photometry of all blue objects
in the cluster core. Our CV census will be both deep enough to be essentially
complete and ``broad'' enough to involve all of the following CV
characteristics: {1} UV brightness; {2} blue FUV spectral shape; {3} strong
CIV and HeII emission; {4} short time-scale {$sim$ minutes} variability
{flickering, WD spin}; {6} intermediate time-scale {$sim$ hours} variability
{orbital variations}; {7} long time-scale {$sim$ weeks} variability {dwarf
nova eruptions}. We will thus uncover the interacting binary population in
M80. In addition, our survey will detect numerous blue stragglers and hot
white dwarfs, as well as any other blue objects in the central regions of this
cluster.

PI:         David Zurek

Our reductions of archival STIS/FUV-MAMA data {AR9225} have discovered 13
completely unexpected and unexplained Ultraviolet bright variables. Eleven of
the variables have been identified with evolved stars {Horizontal Branch or
Asymptotic Giant Branch}. The total number and nature of these systems is
completely unknown. If these variables are binaries the implication is that
the binary fraction {up to 25%} in NGC 1851 is the highest in all Galactic
globular clusters. The radial distributions of the variables and the blue
horizontal branch stars imply a common origin and perhaps an explanation of
the bi-modal morphology of the horizontal branch in the color magnitude
diagrams of globular clusters. These variables may be the tip of the iceberg
and a critical clue concerning the infamous "second parameter". We propose to
observe NGC 1851 on three occasions with the same setup as the archival data
to determine the total number and periods of the ultraviolet variables.

Title:	    When does Bipolarity Impose itself on the Extreme Mass Outflows
	    from AGB Stars? An ACS SNAPshot Survey
PI:         Raghvendra Sahai

Essentially all well-characterized preplanetary nebulae {PPNe} -- objects in
transition between the AGB and planetary nebula evolutionary phases - are
bipolar, whereas the mass-loss envelopes of AGB stars are strikingly
spherical. In order to understand the processes leading to bipolar
mass-ejection, we need to know at what stage of stellar evolution does
bipolarity in the mass-loss first manifest itself? Our previous SNAPshot
surveys of a PPNe sample {with ACS & NICMOS} show that roughly half our
targets observed are resolved, with well-defined bipolar or multipolar
morphologies. Spectroscopic surveys of our sample confirm that these objects
have not yet evolved into planetary nebulae. Thus, the transformation from
spherical to aspherical geometries has already fully developed by the time
these dying stars have become preplanetary nebulae. From this new and
surprising result, we hypothesize that the transformation to bipolarity begins
during the very late AGB phase, and happens very quickly, just before, or as
the stars are evolving off the AGB. We propose to test this hypothesis
quantitatively, through a SNAPshot imaging survey of very evolved AGB stars
which we believe are nascent preplanetary nebulae; with our target list being
drawn from published lists of AGB stars with detected heavy mass-loss {from
millimeter-wave observations}. This survey is crucial for determining how and
when the bipolar geometry asserts itself. Supporting kinematic observations
using long-slit optical spectroscopy {with the Keck}, millimeter and radio
interferometric observations {with OVRO, VLA & VLBA} are being undertaken. The
results from this survey {together with our previous work} will allow us to
draw general conclusions about the onset of bipolar mass-ejection during late
stellar evolution, and will provide crucial input for theories of post-AGB
stellar evolution. Our survey will produce an archival legacy of long-standing
value for future studies of dying stars.

Title:	    A Lyman-alpha Snapshot Survey of FBS and SBS Galaxies
PI:         Claus Leitherer

Search strategies for primeval galaxies rely on the assumption that
Lyman-alpha can be powered by photoionization from hot stars. Theoretical
models, however, indicate that Lyman-alpha is far from being a pure
recombination line: absorption and scattering in the interstellar medium and
the kinematics of outflowing gas make firm predictions for the Lyman-alpha
strength difficult. Therefore observational tests are required. A sample of 42
galaxies with active star formation has been selected from the First and
Second Byurakan Survey to perform such a test. The target galaxies belong to
the spectral class s1, implying they are H II galaxies, blue compact dwarfs,
or nuclear starbursts. This sample is optimized to address whether local
starbursts are strong Lyman-alpha emitters. We propose to obtain STIS G140L
spectra of the galaxies in order to detect Lyman-alpha emission with
equivalent widths larger than 5 Angstroms in this statistically significant,
homogeneous sample. We will utilize the existing, extensive body of
ground-based data to model the stellar population and make a prediction for
the Lyman-alpha emission assuming pure recombination and no radiative transfer
effects by gas and dust. Comparison with the observations will provide
constraints on such effects. The scientific goals are twofold: First, we make
an effort to understand how an apparently simple line, such as Lyman-alpha,
can be affected by radiative transfer effects and geometries in the
interstellar medium of typical star-forming regions. Second, the proposed
study will serve as an empirical test for the probability to succeed in
detecting Lyman-alpha in more distant systems. Therefore, a high-level goal of
this project is to provide guidelines for search strategies for primeval
galaxies at high redshift. This project is ideally suited for execution in
Snapshot mode.

Title:	    Direct imaging of the progenitors of massive, core-collapse
	    supernovae
PI:         Stephen Smartt

Modern supernovae searches in the nearby Universe are discovering large
numbers of SNe which have massive star progenitors {Types II, Ib and Ic}. The
extensive HST image archives of galaxies within ~20Mpc enables their
individual bright stellar content to be resolved. As massive, evolved stars
are the most luminous single objects in a galaxy, the progenitors of
core-collapse SNe should be directly detectable on pre-explosion images. In
our ongoing HST programme we have detected the first red supergiant progenitor
of a normal type II supernova, shown that SN 1993J came from a binary system,
and set direct mass-limits on three other type II supernovae progenitors.
These discoveries are providing strong constraints on theoretical models of
pre-supernova stellar evolution that predict which stars produce which type of
supernovae. We request time to continue this successful project, and require
ACS observations of future SNe which are discovered in galaxies closer than
20Mpc which have pre-explosion HST archive images available. These
observations will allow the SNe to be precisely positioned on the
pre-explosion frames with the required astrometric accuracy of around 0.05",
and provide 3-colour photometry of the surrounding stellar populations for
reddening estimations. The goal of this project is to directly identify the
progenitor stars of core-collapse supernovae. We will compare the results to
our own stellar evolutionary tracks in order to determine masses or
restrictive mass-limits for the progenitors.

We propose new observations of "The Antennae" {NGC 4038/39}, the nearest and
youngest example of a major disk-disk merger, with NICMOS and ACS. The long
overdue NICMOS observations will allow us to penetrate the dust in the Overlap
Region, measure the P_alpha emission and CO band strengths of young clusters,
and study supernova remnants in heavily obscured regions using [FeII] images.
The high resolution {0.05" pixel} ACS observations will allow us for the first
time to reliably distinguish clusters from stars based on their apparent
sizes, and to potentially identify hundreds of supernova remnants that may
control the energy balance and feedback mechanisms within the ISM {based on
[SII] images}. In conjunction with our previous WFPC2, GHRS, and STIS
observations, the new data will provide answers to fundamental questions such
as: How do these clusters form and evolve? How quickly are they destroyed and
what fraction of the field stars were formed in clusters. How many clusters
are hidden by dust? How do the clusters and associated supernovae affect the
local and global ISM? What are the dynamical masses of the clusters, and are
the stellar IMF's truncated? Simultaneous parallel observations will also
determine whether clusters can form in the more quiescent environment of the
inner tails. A better understanding of how mergers form tremendous numbers of
clusters and stars in the local universe will help shed light on processes
that are crucial during galaxy assembly throughout the observable universe.

Title:	    PANS-Probing Acceleration Now with Supernovae
PI:         Adam Riess

Type Ia supernovae {SNe Ia} provide the most direct evidence for an
accelerating Universe, a result widely attributed to dark energy. Using HST in
Cycle 11 we extended the Hubble diagram with 6 of the 7 highest-redshift SNe
Ia known, all at z>1.25, providing conclusive evidence of an earlier epoch of
cosmic deceleration. The full sample of 16 new SNe Ia match the cosmic
concordance model and are inconsistent with a simple model of evolution or
dust as alternatives to dark energy. Understanding dark energy may be the
biggest current challenge to cosmology and particle physics. To understand the
nature of dark energy, we seek to measure its two most fundamental properties:
its evolution {i.e., dw/dz}, and its recent equation of state {i.e., w{z=0}}.
SNe Ia at z>1, beyond the reach of the ground but squarely within the reach of
HST with ACS, are crucial to break the degeneracy in the measurements of these
two basic aspects of dark energy. The SNe Ia we have discovered and measured
with HST in Cycle 11, now double the precision of our knowledge of both
properties. Here we propose to quadruple the sample of SNe Ia at z>1 in the
next two cycles, complementing on-going surveys from the ground at z<1, and
again doubling the precision of dark energy constraints. Should the current
best fit model prove to be the correct one, the precision expected from the
current proposal will suffice to rule out a cosmological constant at the 99%
confidence level. Whatever the result, these objects will provide the basis
with which to extend our empirical knowledge of this newly discovered and
dominant component of the Universe, and will remain one of the most
significant legacies of HST. In addition, our survey and follow-up data will
greatly enhance the value of the archival data within the target Treasury

We will obtain deep, panchromatic imaging photometry of stellar populations in
four fields ranging from 0.5 to 4 scale lengths across the disk of the Local
Group spiral M33. The observations are designed to detect the oldest
main-sequence turnoffs in three outer disk fields, and to reach the crowding
limit in the innermost field. We will combine the photometry data with
information we already have in-hand on abundances from stars and H II regions
in M33 to derive the star formation history and metallicity evolution of the
M33 disk. The information from our four fields will allow us to obtain {1} the
ages of the oldest disk stars and the radial variation of their ages; {2} the
radial variation of the star formation history and its nature {e.g., constant,
declining, or bursting}; and {3} the metallicity distribution in each field
and the time evolution of the metallicity gradient. Our team, an experienced
mix of photometrists, spectroscopists, and galaxy evolution theorists, will
use the results from this program to construct a comprehensive chemo-dynamical
model for the M33 disk. This detailed study of M33 will be a key in developing
an understanding of the formation and evolution of disks that can be applied
to studies of disks at both low and high redshift, and will also yield a

Title:	    A Fundamental Test of Accretion Physics with NGC 4203
PI:         Joseph Shields

The rapid evolution of quasars indicates that supermassive black holes in
galaxy nuclei spend most of their time in a relatively quiescent state.
Studies of nearby galaxies demonstrate that many such black holes are
accreting at a low rate, and appear as low-luminosity active galactic nuclei
{LLAGNs}. Theoretical arguments suggest that the mode of accretion onto a
central black hole may be very different in LLAGNs as compared to
high-luminosity systems. The LINER NGC 4203 provides an excellent opportunity
to investigate quantitatively the accretion process in a LLAGN, and hence the
typical accretion state for a supermassive black hole. Cycle 7 STIS data
acquired at one position angle reveal double-peaked H-alpha emission in the
nucleus that may trace an accretion disk, and spatially resolved emission that
places an upper limit on black-hole mass. We propose observations with STIS to
map the two-dimensional velocity field of the circumnuclear gas disk in the
central regions of NGC 4203, in order to measure the black-hole mass. This
parameter is essential for testing theoretical models of accretion,
determining the mass accretion rate, and estimating the radiative efficiency
for accreted matter. The results will be important for making sense of LLAGNs,
and for translating their measured luminosity into accretion rates that trace
the growth of black holes.

I propose to observe a disappearance of Ganymede behind the dark limb of
Jupiter with five filters of the ACS/HRC camera. Two exposures in each filter
can be taken during such an event. The images will provide the spectral
variation of the altitude of the apparent limb of Jupiter. The altitude of the
apparent limb is dependent on the presence of hazes in Jupiter's stratosphere.
Hazes of vertical optical depths below 0.001 could be detected with these
observations, providing an extremely sensitive probe of high hazes. The
observations probe altitudes levels near the 1-mb pressure level, for which we
have very limited data. The creation of aerosols, their growth, and their
transport by winds is currently a mostly theoretical study. It would
significantly benefit from constraints derived from the proposed observations.
ACS/HRC is the only instrument capable of the required spatial resolution in
the ultraviolet. Furthermore, a favorable geometry of Ganymede's orbit occurs
only once every six years. This proposal achieves unique results with a

We propose to obtain long-slit optical spectra of three nearby quasars with
the largest reported narrow-line regions {NLRs}. These sources have been shown
to be the cornerstone of a most interesting size--luminosity relationship in
AGN-NLRs which, we suspect, is very problematic. A two-orbit HST/STIS
observation, per source, will allow us to measure several narrow emission
lines from H_beta through H_alpha and [S II] at several distances along the
spatial direction. We will thus be able to classify the line excitation
mechanism, estimate the gas density as a function of distance from the center,
and more properly define the 'NLR size'. This will allow us to test the idea
that the NLR conditions in these quasars are very different from those
observed in low luminosity AGN and, specifically, that some of the narrow
emission lines have a star forming origin. Together with our IR spectra of
high-redshift quasars, we will be able to test the newly discovered NLR
size-luminosity relationship in AGN and the AGN-starburst connection at the
high luminosity end.

Title:	    Towards a global understanding of accretion physics - Clues from
	    an UV spectroscopic survey of Cataclysmic Variables
PI:         Boris Gaensicke

Accretion inflows and outflows are fundamental phenomena in a wide variety of
astrophysical environments, such as Young Stellar Objects, galactic binaries,
and AGN. Observationally, cataclysmic variables {CVs}, interacting white
dwarf/main sequence binaries, are particularly well suited for the study of
accretion processes. Furthermore, CVs that are born with a donor more massive
than the white dwarf are potential progenitors of supernovae type Ia. We are
currently carrying out a STIS UV spectroscopic snapshot survey of CVs to fully
exploit the diagnostic potential of these objects for our understanding of
accretion physics. We analyze the STIS spectra with state-of-the-art accretion
disc model spectra {SYNSPEC}, testing our current knowledge of accretion disk
structure, and thereby, providing new insight into the currently poorly
understood process of viscous dissipation. In addition, we use our
parameterised wind model PYTHON for the analysis of the radiation driven
accretion disc wind spectra, assessing the fundamental question whether the
mass loss rate correlates with the disc luminosity. Our survey data also
identify a number of systems in which the white dwarf significantly
contributes to the UV flux, permitting an analysis of the impact of mass
accretion on the evolution of these compact stars. Finally, anomalous N/C
emission line flux ratios unmistakably identify CVs that started out with a
donor more massive than the white dwarf but failed to reach the Chandrasekhar
limit. Determining the number of these "failed SNIa" will provide crucial
input for the population models of this type of system, and, consequently,
improve the predictions on the number of white dwarf binaries that actually do
overcome the Chandrasekhar limit. While the data obtained so far are of
excellent quality, the number of targets that have been observed so far is too
small for a statistically significant analysis. We propose here to extend this
survey into Cycle 13, building a homogenous database of accretion disc and
wind outflow spectra covering a wide range of mass transfer rates and binary
inclinations, and sampling the N/C abundances of at least 100 CVs.

PI:         James Rhoads

We propose deep images of a recently discovered galaxy at z=6.535, which is
among the most luminous Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies known at high redshift.
The brightness and rarity of this source imply that it is associated with a
high peak in the matter density distribution. {It is the brightest Lyman alpha
source in 2e5 comoving Mpc3, with a luminosity of 6 L*.} Further objects in
this peak are expected to be visible with HST's sensitivity. The Lyman alpha
line has a large rest frame equivalent width, with a lower bound >100
Angstroms. Such a large equivalent width would be impossible for objects
embedded in neutral gas, and instead requires either that {a} the universe was
reionized before z=6.5 or {b} the galaxy resides in a local ionized bubble, in
which case an additional contribution to the ionizing photon budget from
presently undetected neighbors is required. With 19 orbits of ACS and NICMOS
imaging, we will measure this object's morphology and spectral energy
distribution, thus searching for either active nuclei or old stellar
populations. We will also search for possible neighbors, which could establish
the first known galaxy group at z>6, and may provide sufficient ionizing flux
to allow the escape of the observed Lyman alpha photons in a neutral universe.
If neighbors are not found, it will lead to an upper bound on the neutral
fraction in the general IGM at z=6.5.

We have obtained deep very Js, H, Ks imaging with the VLT of two fields with
excellent optical imaging, in order to study high redshift galaxies. Using
these Near-IR images, we identified a class of galaxies with Js - Ks color
larger than 2.3. Photometric redshifts and spectroscopic follow-up showed that
their mean redshift is 2.5 +- 0.7. These galaxies are complementary to Lyman
break selected galaxies: the overlap is minimal, and the rest-frame optical
colors of the Js-Ks selected galaxies are much redder. Their contribution to
the stellar mass density is comparable to that of Lyman breaks in our fields.
SED fits and Near-IR spectroscopy of the Js-Ks selected galaxies indicate
median ages between 1 and 2 Gyr, a factor of 3-5 older than the ages of Lyman
break galaxies estimated by similar methods. They are likely the oldest
galaxies at z=2.5, and may be evolving into the most massive galaxies at z=0.
We propose to obtain images of the spectroscopically confirmed Js-Ks galaxies
with the NICMOS/NIC3 camera in the H band. These galaxies lie the field of
MS1054-03, for which we have excellent groundbased and HST optical imaging.
The increased depth and spatial resolution of the NICMOS imaging will allow us
to determine the restframe optical morphologies of the Js - Ks galaxies, in
order to study their intensity profiles and regularity, to decompose the
largest galaxies in bulges and disks, to measure scale lengths, and to look
for evidence of merging and recent star formation. This study would provide us
unique insight into the nature of these red galaxies, their evolutionary

Little is currently known concerning the mass-luminosity relation {MLR} of
Population II stars. In Cycle 10, we began an initial study with FGS1 to
resolve a sample of known spectroscopic binaries preselected as high-velocity
and/or low metallicity objects. This has resulted in significant new
information about the astrophysical parameters of metal-poor stars, but was
limited mainly to intermediate metallicities, not to true Population II stars.
A new sample of metal-poor spectroscopic binaries identified by Latham and his
collaborators {e.g. Latham et al 2002} contains three new very metal-poor
objects resolvable with FGS. We propose to observe these binaries and obtain
additional observations of two very important resolved targets from our
initial sample. As with that program, we will couple the already-known
spectroscopic orbits with astrometric information which only FGS can deliver
at present. To ensure that the most will be gained from these data, we als o
request observations of three metal-poor single stars to be used as
calibration objects. In combination with results from our previous program,
these observations can be expected to resolve the question of the location of
the Population II main sequence and give valuable insight into the accuracy of
isochrone fitting for determination of globular clusters ages. Due to the
combination of target magnitudes and expected separations, no object in this

PI:         Przemyslaw Wozniak

The observed optical depths to microlensing of stars in the Galactic bulge are
difficult to reconcile with our present understanding of Galactic dynamics.
The main source of uncertainty in those comparisons is now shifting from
microlensing measurements to the dynamical models of the Galactic bar. We
propose to constrain the Galactic bar models with proper motion observations
of Bulge stars that underwent microlensing by determining both the kinematic
identity of the microlensed sources and the importance of streaming motions.
The lensed stars are typically farther than randomly selected stars.
Therefore, our proper motion determinations for 36 targeted MACHO events will
provide valuable constraints on the dynamics of bulge stars as a function of
distance. The first epoch data for our proposed events is already available in
the HST archive so the project can be completed within a single HST cycle. The
exceptional spatial resolution of HST is essential for completion of the
project. Constraints on the total mass in the bulge will ultimately lead to
the determination of the amount of dark matter in inner Galaxy.

which HST imaging shows to be single objects are interesting because they
potentially harbor the most massive black holes, and because their existence
places strong constraints on galaxy formation models. When combined with
ground based data already in hand, the objects which HST imaging shows are
superpositions provide valuable information about interaction rates of
early-type galaxies as well as their dust content. They also constrain the

We propose five orbits of ACS Wide Field Camera observations {three orbits
with F814W, one with F606W, and one with F435W} to investigate the unique,
high velocity merging cluster 1E0657-56{z=0.296}. Coupling the ACS images with
deep Chandra observations and ground-based imaging will allow us to compare
maps of the intracluster medium, the dark matter, and the galaxies from which
we can directly estimate the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter,
the dominant mass component in clusters and the Universe. These observations,
combined with hydrodynamic simulations, will either rule out the range of
cross-sections proposed to alleviate problems with collisionless dark matter
or unambiguously detect and measure the self-interaction cross-section. A
secondary objective is to quantify the impact of a supersonic merger on star
formation and the morphological evolution of cluster galaxies. The geometry of
1E0657-56 {with the merger nearly in the plane of the sky} coupled with the
subcluster velocity {4500 km/s} accurately constrains the timescale of the
merger. In particular since the subcluster traversed the dense core of the

Title:	    The Origin of Dwarf Galaxies and Steep Luminosity Functions in
	    Clusters
PI:         Christopher Conselice

Clusters of galaxies contain an overdensity of dwarfs compared to the field.
The origin of these dwarfs is unknown, but a large fraction of them did not
form through standard collapses early in the universe. Some dwarf ellipticals
in clusters have metal rich and young stellar populations while others contain
old metal poor populations, suggesting multiple formation mechanisms and time
scales. We propose to test the idea that dwarfs descend from galaxies accreted
into clusters during the past 8 Gyrs by correlating ages and metallicities of
dwarfs with their internal structures - spiral arms, bars, and disks. If
dwarfs originate from more massive galaxies then these features should be
common in metal rich and young dwarfs. On the other hand, if no correlation is
found it would suggest that dwarfs form through in-situ collapses of gas in
the intragalactic medium after the universe was reionized.

Title:	    Resolving OB Binaries in the Carina Nebula, Resuming the Survey
PI:         Edmund Nelan

In March 2002 we carried out a small, high-angular resolution survey of some
of the brightest OB stars in the Carina Nebula with FGS1r in an attempt to
resolve binary systems which had thus far evaded detection by other
techniques. Of 23 stars observed, 5 new OB binaries were discovered with
component separations ranging from 0.015" to0.325". This yield over the
spatial domain of FGS1r's angular resolution, coupled with published
statistics of the incidence of OB stars in short-period spectroscopic, and
long-period visual binaries suggests that the fraction of binarity or
multiplicity among OB stars is near unity. Our unexpected resolution of the
prototype O2 If* star HD 93129A as a 55 milli-arcsecond double is a case in
point that great care must be excerised when one attemps to establish the IMF
and upper-mass cuttoff at the high-mass end of the HR diagram. We propose to
resume the survey to observe a larger, statistically meaningful sample of OB
stars to establish a firm assessment of multiplicity at the high-mass end of
the IMF in these clusters. We will also investigate the
single-star/binary-star status of several astrophysically important,
individual stars in order to enable a better understanding of the evolution of
high-mass stars.

Title:	    The Deep Lamp Project
PI:         Thomas Ayres

Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph is the most sophisticated space-borne
spectrometer ever built, probably the last of its kind for some time to come.
A key virtue of STIS is that its medium- and high-resolution echelle modes
provide access to broad intervals of the vacuum ultraviolet spectrum in a
single shot. Another virtue is the validation of the wavelength scales by
periodic observations of an onboard hollow-cathode emission line source. Tying
together the different echelle orders by means of the accurately known lamp
spectrum enables a wide range of studies that exploit differential comparisons
of velocity diagnostics in stellar, interstellar, and even extragalactic
spectra. Despite the importance of the wavelength calibrations, however, they
are done only infrequently {once a year}. While STIS undoubtedly must be one
of the most stable orbiting spectrographs ever designed, possible thermal
distortions of the instrument might cause small nonlinear deviations of the
wavelength scales and thereby impact the velocity precision. The existing
wavecal data sets are separated too far apart in time to isolate short-term
thermal fluctuations from long-term secular behavior, and the routine
WAVELINEs taken with every grating switch are too underexposed to reveal any
differential behavior across the spectrum, aside from a simple zero-point
offset. I therefore propose to obtain a series of deep lamp exposures in a few
representative modes of the NUV and FUV MAMAs to search for and characterize
short-term differential distortions of the echelle formats. This work also
will provide an important dataset to test new approaches to derive the basic
dispersion relations, such as the effort underway by the Physical Modeling
Group at ESA's ST-ECF. The calibration campaign can be scheduled in pure
parallel mode with no loss of orbits from the Cycle 13 science program.

Title:	    Evolution of Light Echoes of SN 1993J
PI:         Ben Sugerman

SN 1993J is the nearest SN in the last decade, and only one of seven objects
to produce confirmed light echoes. Our analyses of archival HST/WFPC2 datareve
aled that the SN has illuminated at least two light-echo structures in the
galaxy M81. Those echoes appear to define two sheets of dust, located roughly
260 ly and 770 ly in front of the SN, which are the first, and most efficient,
3-D probes of the ISM in M81. The echoes not only reveal the ISM's structure,
but also constrain the density, composition and grain-size of its dust. Echoes
are transient events, and as they change on timescales shorter than a year,
continued monitoring will reveal new illuminated material, tracing
interstellar and circumstellar structure. We propose a modest and highly
efficient campaign by HST to image these and yet undiscovered echoes toward SN
1993J. Such observations will build the first direct 3-D map of the ISM within
a million cubic parsecs of M81's spiral arm, and may glimpse the circumstellar
environment affected by the projenitor's mass loss. Such results probe the
nature of extragalactic dust, reveal spatio-kinematic information about the
M81's disk, tightly constrain its internal extinction, and under the proper
circumstances, provide an independent distance measurement to the host galaxy.

Title:	    Critical STIS Spectroscopy and ACS Imagery at the Top of the IMF
PI:         Nolan Walborn

We shall observe two key massive hot stars to investigate the effects of
multiplicity and rotational mixing on their parameters and evolution. {1} The
prototype O2 If* star HD 93129A dominates the compact cluster Trumpler 14, one
of the ionizing clusters of the Carina Nebula. It has been an anchor point for
analyses of the most massive stars. Unexpectedly, it has been resolved as a 55
mas binary by FGS. The derived delta m of 0.9 implies that the companion may
be similar to the O3 dwarfs HD 93128 and HD 93129B {3" from A} in Tr 14.
Recent radio and X-ray data suggest that the HD 93129A system is a
colliding-wind binary. We propose to resolve the system spectroscopically with
STIS in both the optical and FUV. Also, we plan an orbit of very short ACS
exposures on this key cluster to obtain resolved multicolor photometry of its
crowded inner members for the first time. {2} The recent discovery of a CNO
dichotomy among five O2 giants in the Magellanic Clouds provides a new
evolutionary diagnostic for the most massive stars, which is related to their
initial rotational velocities. The abundance anomalies are seen in the UV wind
spectra as well as optical lines. We propose to observe the FUV spectrum of
the LMC ON2 star LH10-3061 with STIS to support further analysis, since it is
the only one of these stars lacking UV data.

Title:	    What drives the outflows in powerful radio galaxies?
PI:         Clive Tadhunter

There is increasing speculation that activity-induced outflows are an
important feedback mechanism in evolution of galaxy bulges, yet uncertainties
remain about the nature, dominant driving mechanism and powers of the
outflows. In order to address these issues, we propose to make deep ACS and
STIS observations of two compact radio sources in which we recently found
unequivocal evidence for powerful emission line outflows, and in which all the
potential drivers for the outflows -- quasar nuclei, relativistic jets and
starbursts -- are known to be present. Using the unique capabilities of
HST/ACS we will map the outflow regions in these sources at high spatial
resolution and thereby determine the dominant outflow driving mechanism. In
addition, by combining the morphological information from the ACS data with
information on the kinematics and physical conditions derived from STIS and
ground-based spectra, we will determine the mass outflow rates and powers in
the outflows. This will be the first comprehensive study of the near-nuclear
outflows in radio galaxies. Such studies are crucial for determining whether
the activity associated with powerful extragalactic radio sources has a major
impact on the evolution of the host early-type galaxies.

Title:	    Star Formation in Damped Lya Galaxies: Testing the Connection with

PI:         Jason Prochaska

The principal challenge of damped Lya {DLA} research is to identify and study
the stellar components of these galaxies. Although two decades of
absorption-line research has yielded the HI gas content, metallicity, velocity
fields, molecular and dust content of these galaxies only a handful have been
studied in emission. Therefore, it has been very difficult to compare the DLA
galaxies with the successful surveys of high z galaxies discovered in emission
{e.g. Lyman break galaxies; LBG}. This is particulary important given that DLA
systems are the probable precursors to galaxies like the Milky Way. Because
the DLA systems are identified toward bright background quasars, deep
observations at high spatial resolution with astable PSF are essential and
only HST provides the observing capability. Recently, two major advances have
greatly enhanced the prospects for measuring emission from DLA host galaxies:
{1} we have developed a new spectroscopic technique for inferring the star
formation rates {SFR} of the DLA which enables one to pre-select the brightest
candidates; {2} the high spatial resolution and sensitivity of the ACS
represents a major improvement over previous capabilities. We will obtain deep
V-band images with the ACS of 5 high z DLA with the highest inferred apparent
optical magnitudes. The complete survey will offer a robust satistical
analysis of: {a} the extent and morphology of the DLA star forming regions;
{b} the likelihood that the DLA and LBG correspond to the same population of
protogalaxies; {c} a test of the protogalactic clump models favored by CDM
cosmology. We emphasize this program will offer a major advance over all
previous studies. Finally, we will complement these HST observations with an
extensive observing campaign {IFU spectroscopy and deep IR imaging} on the
Keck, VLT, and Magellan telescopes to provide the most extensive dataset yet

mass companions with masses down to 6 Jupiter masses, and at separations
larger than 3 A.U. are bright enough for a direct detection with HST/NICMOS
using the spectral differential imaging technique in two narrow-band filters

PI:         Thomas Rauch

We propose UV spectroscopy of the four unique post-AGB stars of spectral type
O{He} in order to understand the origin of their peculiar surface abundances.
These stars are the only known amongst the hottest post-AGB stars {effective
temperatures > 100, 000 K} whose atmospheres are composed of almost pure
helium. This chemistry markedly differs from that of the hydrogen-deficient
post-AGB evolutionary sequence with objects which have carbon dominated
atmospheres {PG1159 stars and Wolf-Rayet central stars}. While PG1159 and
Wolf-Rayet stars are the result of a late helium-shell flash, this scenario
cannot explain the O{He} stars. Instead, they are possibly double-degenerate
mergers. We speculate that the four O{He} stars represent evolved RCrB stars,
which also have helium dominated atmospheres. We aim to determine the C, N, O,
and Si abundances precisely, in order to proof this evolutionary link.

Title:	    Groups of Dwarf Galaxies: Pools of Mostly Dark Matter?
PI:         R. Tully

Within 5 Mpc, there are 6 groups with well-known luminous galaxies but there
also appears to be a comparable number of groups containing only dwarfs. If
these dwarf entities are truly bound then M/L values are an order of magnitude
higher than values found for groups with luminous spiral galaxies. There are
theoretical reasons to anticipate that low mass halos may frequently be mostly
dark. The dynamical influence of low mass halos is negligible in familiar
groups with luminous members. By contrast, a study of the dynamics of `groups
of dwarfs' may provide direct evidence of the existence of dark matter
potential wells with few baryons. The goal of the present study is to gather
detailed information on the 3-D distribution of dwarf galaxies suspected to
lie within 7 groups of dwarfs within 5 Mpc. Distances with 7% relative
accuracy can be measured with the Tip of the Giant Branch method with ACS and
integrations within 1 orbit per target.

PI:         Smita Mathur

The main reservoir of low redshift baryons is still ``missing'': All the
observed stellar and gaseous components add up to a factor of ten below the
abundance predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis. Hydrodynamic cosmological
simulations predict that a large fraction of the low redshift baryons should
reside in a warm/hot diffuse intergalactic medium {IGM}, detectable via an
``X-ray forest'' of high excitation metal lines, but blind searches of X-ray
lines are extraordinarily difficult with present technology. A first hint of
this warm-hot IGM may have been found in recent studies of OVI absorption
towards background quasars. However, the significance of OVI absorbers to the
total baryon budget is uncertain and UV observations alone cannot determine
the physical conditions in the IGM. We propose STIS/E140M observations to
search for intervening OVI absorbers towards two quasars that are bright
enough in X-rays for follow-up Chandra spectroscopy. The combined UV/X-ray
study provides a powerful tool to {1} assess the cosmological significance of
OVI absorbers; {2} determine their physical properties using OVII/OVI and
OVIII/OVI ratios; and {3} pursue detection and study of the warm-hot IGM.

Title:	    A Critical Test for Radiatively Driven Hot Winds in Cool Stars
PI:         Alex Lobel

We propose STIS observations of the C IV resonance emission line profiles for
the two brightest short-period classical Cepheid variables Delta Cep and Beta
Dor, to critically test if P Cygni-type profiles form in the hot transition
region plasmas of their pulsating upper atmospheres. Recent FUSE observations
of the cool {non-variable} G-supergiant Alpha Aqr {and Beta Aqr} show a
distinct P Cygni-type profile in warm transition region emission lines of C
III. The observations reveal supersonic wind outflow velocities that exceed
~140 km/s, based on our semi-empiric radiative transfer models. The models
demonstrate that optically thick supersonic winds occur in the outer
atmospheres of cool giant and supergiant stars, at kinetic gas temperatures
well above 80 kK. STIS observations of cool regular pulsating Cepheid
variables will confirm or reject our present hypothesis that these peculiar P
Cygni-type line shapes form in a supersonic accelerating wind structure that
is {partly} driven by a radiative atmospheric acceleration mechanism,
generally adopted for driving the much faster winds of hot luminous stars.
STIS observations of the detailed line shapes of hot transition region
emission lines in Cepheids can establish an important physical link between
the radiation-driven wind theory of hot stars, and the acoustic/magnetic
wave-driven wind theory of cool stars. The proposed high-resolution far-UV
spectra of these important pulsating cool stars will be an invaluable
contribution to the HST Archive.

Aim of this proposal is to perform high-resolution imaging of the proposed
optical counterparts of the two, radio silent, isolated neutron stars
RXJ1308.6+2127 and RX J1605.3+3249 with the STIS/50CCD. Imaging both fields
with the same instrumental configuration used in mid 2001 by Kaplan et al
{2002; 2003}, will allow us to measure the objects' position and to determine
their proper motions over a time base of nearly four years. The measurement of
proper motions at the level of at least few tens mas/yr, expected for
relatively nearby neutron stars, would unambigouosly secure the proposed
optical identifications, not achievable otherwise. In addition, the knowledge
of the proper motion will provide useful indications on the space velocity and
distance of these neutrons stars, as well as on the radius. Constraining these
parameters is of paramount importance to discriminate between the variety of
emission mechanisms invoked to explain their observed thermal X-ray spectra
and to probe the neutron star equation of state {EOS}. The determination of
the proper motion is a decisive step toward a dedicated follow-up program
aimed at measuring the objects' optical parallax, thus providing much firmer
constrains on the star properties, again to be performed with the STIS/50CCD.

one of the two ULXs is in a peculiar star-forming complex: we have suggested
that it is an expanding wave of star-formation triggered by a dwarf galaxy
plunging through the outer disk of NGC 4559. The ACS observation will also

We propose a near-UV {3000-5500AA} long-slit spectroscopic study of a sample

from our Cycle 11 ACS near-UV snapshot survey. This survey collected HST
U-band images for 78 galaxies, which also have optical and near-IR images
available in the archive. We propose to enrich this image database with STIS

availability of the near-UV images which will allow us to select the best slit
centering and orientation to probe the circumnuclear structures. Our goal is
to investigate the nature of these structures, characterizing the
circumnuclear continuum and ionizing source of these galaxies at a spatial
resolution of $sim$10 parsecs, where we will probe the black hole environment.
With the proposed observations, we will derive properties of the circumnuclear
stellar populations of the selected galaxies {ages, masses and metallicities},
evolutionary effects connecting the growth of the black hole with the growth
of the galaxy bulge, as well as the relation between the black hole mass,
accretion rate {luminosity} and the circumnuclear stellar population
properties. This dataset will also allow us to study the effect of the bulge

The masses of the giant black holes in galaxies are correlated with the
luminosities, masses, and velocity dispersions of their host spheroids. This
empirical connection of phenomena on widely different scales {from sub-parsec
to kiloparsec} suggests that the evolution of a galaxy and its central black
hole are closely linked. We propose to test various unified formation models,
by measuring the cosmic evolution of the black hole/spheroid relations, back
to z=0.37 {a lookback time of 4 Gyrs}. We will obtain 1-orbit ACS images of a
sample of 20 Seyfert 1 galaxies, for which we already have extensive new
ground-based measures of the black hole masses and the stellar velocity
dispersions. HST resolution is required for accurate measurement of the
nonstellar AGN continuum, and the luminosity and effective radius of the bulge
of each host galaxy. This will complete the set of observables needed to map
the co-evolution of spheroids and black-holes. The proposed sample is the
minimum required to make the first measure of the black hole mass/bulge

around another lighter white dwarf. VLT optical spectra showed faint and broad
{1500km/s FWHM} HeII {mainly} emission lines, even though the presence of H
can not be completely ruled out due to spectral resolution. Moreover, recent
XMM observations with the OM confirmed that the broad band energy spectrum of
this source peaks in the UV band, making it one of the best target for HST
studies. Here we propose to use the STIS spectroscopic capability of HST in
the TIME-TAG mode. The latter mode is extremely well suited for our purposes,
since will allow us, among other things, to perform, for the first time, an
Orbital Phase Spectroscopy of the expected He lines {also those of C, N and O
are expected} in the STIS spectra. We expect to finally probe the nature of
the source by following the emission line centroid shift as a function of the

Young stars with circumstellar material are common, but their properties vary
greatly. Current studies strongly suggest that Beta Pictoris {A5 V} is an
early solar system. If the high-density, high-velocity circumstellar gas
falling toward Beta Pic were fueled by grazing comets or on-going erosion of
debris located close to the star, we would expect to find evidence for warm
dust in all Beta Pic-like systems. We have carried out detailed studies of the
circumstellar environments of all nearby A-type stars. We have studied not
only their circumstellar dust but also the characteristics of their
circumstellar gas through absorption line spectroscopy. Based on our visible
and IUE data, we identified about a dozen A-type stars with circumstellar gas.
Among them, 7 have dynamic circumstellar gas similar to that found in the Beta
Pic system, but none of them has detectable IRAS infrared excess. What is the
origin of the dynamic circumstellar gas around young A-type stars? The STIS
wavelength range covers many fine-structure lines that can only be seen at
high densities, which are characteristic of circumstellar but not interstellar
gas. We propose to observe these 7 stars with STIS to {a} verify the
circumstellar gas detections from our previous visible and IUE studies, {b}
determine the temperature and electron number density in the circumstellar
gas, {c} derive accurate circumstellar gas column densities, and {d} study the

Title:	    Probing the Nucleosynthesis Products of the First Stars
PI:         Christopher Sneden

We propose the first extensive HST study of Galactic halo stars that are
deficient in heavy {i.e., neutron-capture} elements. These so-called r-
process-poor stars contain the nucleosynthesis products from the earliest
generations of stars, the progenitors of the halo stars. Detections of the
lightest neutron-capture elements, such as Ge, along with some of the
heaviest, including Pt, can only be obtained in the NUV. Our HST abundance
analysis of the well-known bright {r-process-poor} giant star HD 122563
indicates a surprising drop off in neutron-capture element abundances from Ge
to Pt. This is in contrast to the solar pattern seen in r-process-rich stars,
and suggests that some of the very earliest generations of stars were unable
to synthesize the heaviest elements. To confirm and strengthen this finding we
will obtain abundance determinations for a number of neutron-capture elements
in a target sample of 8 stars, spanning a wide range of metallicity. The
resulting abundance distributions will provide a direct indication of the
nucleosynthetic conditions {such as temperatures, densities, and neutron
fluxes} in the halo progenitors. These in turn will help to identify the

Title:	    Uncovering the unknown Ly-alpha flux in classical T Tauri stars
PI:         Gregory Herczeg

The FUV emission of CTTSs significantly impacts the chemical evolution and
aids in the dispersal of gas in protoplanetary disks. Despite its importance,
the dominant source of FUV emission, H I Ly-alpha at 1215.67 A, is not
directly observable due to neutral hydrogen absorption in our line of sight to
nearly all young stars. We have recently developed a novel technique to
indirectly measure the Ly-alpha emission incident on the disk using Ly-alpha
pumped molecular hydrogen emission lines, which are detected throughout the UV
spectra of CTTSs. Measuring the Ly-alpha flux has a large effect of the total
FUV emission from CTTSs: results from test cases demonstrate that at least 75%
of the FUV emission is in this one line. The lack of accurate measurements of
Ly-alpha remains a glaring weakness in chemical models of protoplanetary disks
and disk dispersal. This strong emission will create a Ly-alpha dominated
PDR-like disk surface at planet-forming radii close to the star. We propose
using molecular hydrogen emission to reconstruct the intrinsic Ly-alpha line
from three CTTSs to understand the dominant FUV emission source from these
stars and its effect on protoplanetary disks.

Title:	    Probing a damped Lyman-alpha system along two lines of sight
PI:         Nicholas Morgan

Damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems hold key information about galaxy
formation and chemical evolution of the Universe. We have recently discovered
that the bright {V = 15.5} z=1.07 quasar HS 2209+1914 is a gravitationally
lensed double with an image separation of 1.0 arcsec and a clearly detected
lensing galaxy. A strong Mg II and Fe II absorption systems at z=0.51 is very
suggestive of a common damped Ly-alpha absorber {DLA} in both lines of sight,
presumably identical with the lensing galaxy. We propose to obtain UV
spectroscopy of both QSO components, with the principal aim to confirm the DLA
hypothesis and obtain the column density of neutral hydrogen along both lines
of sight. This will enable future high-resolution spectroscopy to determine
elemental abundances and their spatial variance between different locations in
the absorber. In combination with new ground-based deep infrared images, HS
2209+1914 will be the only known DLA galaxy where spatially resolved abundance
information can be directly related to the observed distribution of stellar
light. Byproducts of our study will include new insights into the lensing
geometry of the system, a high S/N measurement of differential extinction
through the lensing galaxy, and an estimate of the lensing galaxy's extinction

	    Feedback Scenarios
PI:         Nahum Arav

AGN outflows impact the evolution of supermassive black holes, host galaxies,
and the surrounding IGM. To assess the importance of these processes, it is
essential to obtain the physical properties of real AGN winds. Our proposed
HST/STIS observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 509, in combination with
dedicated FUSE time, are designed to obtain the first reliable determination
of chemical abundances for an AGN outflow. Previous attempts to measure
abundances from outflow absorption troughs did not account for velocity
dependent covering factors of the absorbers. This led to large uncertainties
in measuring absorption column densities, uncertainties which are magnified
when translated to abundances. To extract reliable column densities, we
created an array of analysis tools for modeling high-S/N echelle data of
doublets and higher multiplet lines from the same ion. After carefully
reviewing all the available targets we conclude that the combination of high
UV flux and unblended outflow troughs makes Mrk 509 the most promising target
for obtaining abundances in AGN outflows. Our proposed Mrk 509 observations
will provide the best input to date for accurately modeling the influence of
AGN winds on the galactic and inter-galactic environments.

We propose to continue managing the NICMOS pure parallel program. Based on our
experience, we are well prepared to make optimal use of the parallel
opportunities. The improved sensitivity and efficiency of our observations
will substantially increase the number of line-emitting galaxies detected. As
our previous work has demonstrated, the most frequently detected line is
Halpha at 0.7<z<1.9, which provides an excellent measure of current star
formation rate. We will also detect star-forming and active galaxies in other
redshift ranges using other emission lines. The grism observations will
produce by far the best available Halpha luminosity functions over the
crucial--but poorly observed--redshift range where galaxies appear to have
assembled most of their stellar mass. This key process of galaxy evolution
needs to be studied with IR data; we found that observations at shorter
wavelengths appear to have missed a large fraction of the star-formation in
galaxies, due to dust reddening. We will also obtain deep F110W and F160W
images, to examine the space densities and morphologies of faint red galaxies.
In addition to carrying out the public parallels, we will make the fully
reduced and calibrated images and spectra available on-line, with some
ground-based data for the deepest parallel fields included.

Title:	    Globular Cluster Systems of Giant, Post-Starburst Shell
	    Ellipticals
PI:         Paul Goudfrooij

Mergers seem to have played a major role in determining the shapes and
dynamics of elliptical galaxies. A few galactic mergers still occur and offer
valuable clues to past evolutionary processes. Young globular clusters formed
during mergers hold strong promise for age-dating such events, besides helping
shed light on the cluster-formation process itself. With young globulars in
ongoing mergers and ~0.5 Gyr old remnants now well studied {NGC 4038/39, 3256,
7252, and 3921}, we propose to observe 4 bona fide ellipticals featuring
ripples, tidal tails as well as post-starburst spectra {E+A galaxies: strong
Balmer absorption}, which are obvious candidates for having undergone a
dissipative merger 1-4 Gyr ago. If the globulars formed during mergers are
formed with a normal IMF, they should still be around in large numbers in
intermediate-age systems. If that is indeed the case, it would constitute
strong evidence in favor of the scenario in which metal-rich globulars in
'normal' ellipticals are formed in merging events. We plan to use these ACS
observations to {1} measure high-accuracy {g-I error of 0.1 mag} colors for
clusters as faint as the peak of the luminosity function {LF} of old
globulars, {2} use these colors to separate first- and second-generation
clusters, and {3} determine the LFs of the two kinds of clusters down to 1.5
mag past the LF peak for old globulars. Deep dithered g&I-band images form a
crucial part of our observing strategy. When combined with previous HST
studies of globulars in mergers, this study will yield about a dozen globular
cluster systems with age estimates, enough to make meaningful statements about
the influence of mergers in creating "red'', metal-rich globulars in giant E's
and the evolution of the specific frequency of globular clusters during
galactic mergers.

We propose to conduct a comprehensive high angular resolution study of the
newly discovered debris disk around GJ 803. This nearby, young star has an
estimated age of 8-20 Myr, a critical epoch in disk evolution and planet
formation. By virtue of its proximity {10 pc} and nearly edge-on orientation,
GJ 803's disk has an exceptional surface brightness and angular size relative
to other disks resolved in scattered light thus far. Hence, this system offers
an exciting new opportunity to study debris disks. Our proposed ACS and NICMOS
imaging will elucidate the disk morphology, ascertain the grain properties as
a function of radius, and search for fine dynamical structure indicative of
the presence of planets. ACS WFC and NICMOS coronagraphic imaging will explore
the inner disk, which includes the ~17 AU inner disk hole inferred from the
star's spectral energy distribution. Complementary ACS WFC imaging will probe
the outer disk {>70 AU}; at such large distances around GJ 803, dust
evolutionary timescales are longer than the stellar age, and hence we can
study the composition of primordial circumstellar material. The combined
dataset will provide the most comprehensive study to date of a debris disk
from ~7 AU to ~200 AU radius.

Title:	    Radial Velocity Variability in the Mass Outflow in the Seyfert 1
	    Galaxy NGC 3783
PI:         Jack Gabel

We have discovered a decreasing radial velocity in an outflowing UV absorber
in NGC 3783 -- the first unambiguous detection of kinematic variability in an
AGN outflow. The observed velocity shift could be due either to bulk
deceleration of the outflow or a geometric effect, in which the radially
projected component of velocity changes as the outflow moves across our line
of sight. Several pieces of evidence support the latter interpretation. A
simple geometric model of an absorber with a changing velocity vector predicts
the absorption line depths will decrease sometime before mid-2005, at an
increasingly rapid rate, and eventually disappear. We propose three STIS E140M
observations, obtained at 4 -- 8 months intervals, to determine the underlying
mechanism causing this rare phenomenon. Specifically, these observations will
allow us to: 1} track the radial velocity variations, 2} follow the evolution
of the covering factors, thereby mapping the geometry and transverse motion of
the absorber against the background AGN light, 3} determine the ionization
structure in the outflow by monitoring ionization-dependent coverage, and 4}
test for changes in the ionization of the absorber using photoionization
models. These results will provide a definitive test of the geometric model,
and will place strong limits on alternative mechanisms. In addition, we have
also been allocated two FUSE observations of NGC 3783 in the upcoming cycle.
We request simultaneous observations in at least one epoch, which will place
very tight constraints on the absorption/emission geometry. These results will
provide crucial input needed to test dynamical models of AGN outflows.

We have found He II absorption in a quasar at redshift 3.82 via our Cycle 12
program of UV snapshots. This is the highest redshift yet at which He II
absorption has been observed, and we propose a high S/N STIS follow-on
spectrum to study helium ionization in the IGM along this new, long,
unobscured sightline to high-redshift. The object has UV flux comparable to
that of the rare handful of other z>3 quasars known to be suitable for helium
studies, and it is also in the Continuous Viewing Zone, permitting a
high-quality STIS spectrum in just 8 HST orbits. The proposed spectrum will
allow us to study the evolution and properties of the IGM and ionizing
radiation from z=3.8 {the IGM environment near the quasar} all the way down to
z=2.8. This redshift range may span the epoch of helium reionization, and even
extends to high enough redshift to enable improved helium opacity measures
using both He II Ly-alpha and Ly-beta. This program is now approved to use ACS

PI:         Scott Friedman

Measuring the abundance of deuterium relative to hydrogen in the interstellar
medium provides a method to assess the effects on the D/H ratio of astration
and subsequent chemical enrichment of the ISM by supernovae, massive star
winds, infalling gas, and mixing. It is now well established that D/H is
approximately constant within the Local Bubble, at distances <~ 100 pc. At
greater distances there is limited but growing evidence that it varies.
However, confirmation of this, and a more definitive interpretation of the
variability, requires improved measurements of the HI column density, which
can only come from STIS measurements of the Ly alpha line. We request
observations of 7 targets, all well outside the Local Bubble based on their DI
column densities, to establish the degree of variability with high confidence.
FUSE observations to determine N{DI} are complete for 5 targets, the remaining
~30% of the data on a 6th target is scheduled to be obtained at the end of
January, 2004, and the last target is part of an accepted FUSE cycle 5
program. With the improved HI column densities obtained with the observations
proposed here, we will confirm the variability indicated by a small number of
IMAPS and FUSE sight lines, and we will place important constraints on models
of chemical evolution and mixing.

Using UV observations with SBC and PR110L, we will obtain spectra of 3 newly
discovered pulsating white dwarfs found among recent cataclysmic variables
identified in the SDSS. Our Cycle 8 observations of the only previously known
accreting, pulsating, white dwarf in GW Lib revealed large amplitude UV
pulsations, a spectrum that showed metals and required a dual temperature fit
with a high white dwarf mass. Since accretion likely causes abundance,
rotation, and atmospheric temperature differences in accreting white dwarfs
versus single white dwarfs, we will use these systems to explore the location
of the instability strip for accreting white dwarfs and determine whether they
are all massive and spotted objects. Light curves can be constructed at
different wavelengths to aid in mode identification. Having knowledge of the
atmospheres and interior structure of 4 sytems will provide great insight into
the interaction of accretion, stellar pulsation and long term evolution. Due
to optical contamination by the disk, stream, and/or secondary, the UV is the
optimum regime to study pulsating, accreting white dwarfs.

Extensive studies of Be stars in the Milky Way {MW}, from optical to X-Ray
wavelengths, showed that this class of objects gives important clues to our
understanding of issues of broad relevance, among them the dynamo mechanism,
stellar evolution {single/binary}, circumstellar disks, variability and
mechanisms for X-ray emission. Moreover, the classical prototype {from optical
studies} of this class, gamma Cas, has turned out to be unique in its X-ray
properties. Can we find gamma Cas analogs in other galaxies? How does the Be
phenomenon depend on metallicity ? We propose to extend the study of Be stars
to the low metallicity Small Magellanic Cloud {SMC}. We selected a small,
exploratory but significant, sample of Be stars detected from our extensive
ground-based surveys. Because many crucial properties can only be measured in
the UV, we propose to obtain STIS UV spectra to complement our data at other

order to: {1} characterize the SMC counterpart of the Be class, so far only

PI:         Igor Karachentsev

The distribution of dark vs. luminous matter on scales of 0.1-1.0 Mpc remains
poorly understood. For a nearby group, the total mass can be determined from
the radius of "the zero-velocity surface", which separates the group from the
general Hubble flow. This new method requires the measurement of accurate
distances and radial velocities of galaxies around the group, but gives total
mass estimates independent of assumptions about the state of relaxation or
orbital characteristics. The mass pertains to the group at the full scale to
which it is bound. Upon application in several nearest groups, the method
yields mass estimates in agreement with the sum of the virial masses of
subcomponents. However, the typical total M/L ratio for the nearby groups of
~30 Mo/Lo implies a local mean density of matter which is only 1/7 the
canonical global density . The nearby complex of galaxies around Cen A and M83
resembles our Local Group by the dumb-bell concentration of objects around a
pair of dominant galaxies. Accurate distances have been acquired recently for
~20 group members by the TRGB method using HST. We will measure TRGB distances
to the 17 remaining galaxies in the region. These observations will constrain
the dynamical state of the halo surrounding the nearest giant E-galaxy Cen A,

We propose to obtain high-resolution STIS E230H SNAP observations of MgII and
FeII interstellar absorption lines toward stars within 100 parsecs that
already have moderate or high-resolution far-UV {FUV}, 900-1700 A,
observations available in the MAST Archive. Fundamental properties, such as
temperature, turbulence, ionization, abundances, and depletions of gas in the
local interstellar medium {LISM} can be measured by coupling such
observations. Due to the wide spectral range of STIS, observations to study
nearby stars also contain important data about the LISM embedded within their
spectra. However, unlocking this information from the intrinsically broad and
often saturated FUV absorption lines of low-mass ions, {DI, CII, NI, OI},
requires first understanding the kinematic structure of the gas along the line
of sight. This can be achieved with high resolution spectra of high-mass ions,
{FeII, MgII}, which have narrow absorption lines, and can resolve each
individual velocity component {interstellar cloud}. By obtaining short {~10
minute} E230H observations of FeII and MgII, for stars that already have
moderate or high-resolution FUV spectra, we can increase the sample of LISM
measurements, and thereby expand our knowledge of the physical properties of
the gas in our galactic neighborhood. STIS is the only instrument capable of

Title:	    Low-Ionization BALs: Evolution or Orientation?
PI:         Xiaohui Fan

We propose to test the hypothesis that Low-Ionization Broad Absorption Line
Quasars {LoBALs} represent a special stage of quasar evolution: young quasars
in systems with strong interaction and star-formation.	We will carry out high
resolution imaging using ACS/WFC and NICMOS to measure the properties of the
host galaxies of four LoBAL quasars at z = 0.9 - 2.0 that show strong
overlapping FeII absorption troughs. The ACS imaging will be carried out in
the passband with the strongest BAL absorption, acting as a natural
coronagraph. This results in a reduction of quasar light by a factor of 15 -
26 in these passbands, providing arguably the best view of the host galaxies
of luminous, high-redshift quasars. This method allows efficient detection and
detailed modeling of the host galaxy morphology in the rest-frame ultraviolet,
which is most sensitive to star formation and galaxy interaction.  We will
also use NICMOS imaging to measure the rest-frame light from the host galaxy
to probe the old stellar populations where the host galaxy is likely to be
brighter.
It has been suggested that LoBALs might not be explained simply as an
orientation effect but rather as an early phase of quasar evolution.  Such a
phase is typically associated with large amounts of dust and gas, and young
galaxies with strong star formation.  With HST observations, we will study the
color and morphology of the FeLoBAL quasar host galaxies, and measure the age
of their dominant stellar populations.	We will also measure the density of
close companions, and, in particular, look for signs of ongoing or recent
mergers.  These measurements will be compared to those of control samples of
normal quasars at similar redshift.  If LoBALs are indeed young systems, then
their host galaxies are expected to show stronger interactions and merger
activity, younger stellar ages, and regions with strong star formation.  If
the LoBAL host galaxies show no significant difference from those of normal
quasars, it will support the view that LoBAL quasars are not a distinct
population and that all quasars have BAL outflows along some lines of sight.

PI:         Aaron Barth

Hundreds of orbits of HST time have been devoted to measurements of the masses
of black holes in the centers of nearby galaxies, using the kinematics of
either stars or ionized gas disks. Gas-dynamical measurements are far simpler
in terms of observations and analysis, but are subject to systematic
uncertainties since the gas disks may not be rotating at the local circular
velocity. Cross-checks between the two methods are critically important, but
to date there has not been any direct test of the two methods to determine
whether they would give consistent results for the same galaxy. We propose to
compare stellar-dynamical and gas-dynamical measurements of the black hole
masses in two S0 galaxies, NGC 3245 and NGC 1380, that we have selected as
excellent candidates for both techniques. This direct comparison will help to
clarify the amount of intrinsic scatter in the black hole mass vs. stellar

provides an important link between well-studied nearby H II regions like
Orion, and more distant mini-starbusts like 30 Doradus. CVZ orbits will allow
extremely efficient use of HST to map a large area of this complex and
important region -- more than 95 percent of the proposed survey will be
observed by HST for the first time. This survey will provide a complete census
of microjets, proplyds, and silhouette disks with diameters as small as 200
AU, enough to spatially resolve disks like those in Orion, and will provide
the first catalog of outflows {jets} from embedded low-mass stars, thin
filamentary shocks, and wind-wind collisions in Carina. An accurate census of
these phenomena is needed to characterize the star formation activity and gas
dynamics as a function of position in the nebula, and to determine if models
for protoplanetary disk evaporation from Orion are applicable in more extreme
regions. Our previous ground-based optical and IR surveys have already

Title:	    Pre-History of a Starburst: Deep Imaging of IC 10
PI:         Andrew Cole

The peculiar Local Group dwarf galaxy IC 10 is the nearest case of a starburst
in progress. Starburst galaxies are a prime laboratory for studying the
physical processes which regulate star formation in galaxies; as the closest
example, IC 10 is potentially the key galaxy for understanding the starburst
phenomenon. We propose to obtain deep optical images of IC 10 with the ACS/WFC
to achieve three main goals: 1} To make the first estimates of the pre-burst
history of IC 10 based on morphological and statistical analysis of its {V, I}
color-magnitude diagram; 2} to search for evidence of a past history of
burst-dormancy cycles; and 3} to explore the connection between the ages and
locations of bright stars and the large-scale structure of the interstellar
medium. The distance {0.8 Mpc}, extinction {2.5 mag}, and high surface
brightness of IC 10 make these goals unobtainable except with HST. The
observations proposed here will yield far and away the deepest images, in
absolute magnitudes, ever obtained for any starburst galaxy. Our photometry
will reach to magnitudes {V, I} = {28.5, 27.5}, which is below the level of
the red clump/horizontal branch and the location of the main-sequence turnoff
of stars as old as a billion years. For the first time, it will be possible to
measure the detailed history of a starburst host for the Gigayear time period
leading up to the burst. The horizontal branch morphology and colors will
provide new information on the metallicity and age distribution of stars
spanning the entire age of IC 10. Because of its close distance, IC 10 is the
ONLY starburst galaxy for which this type of information is obtainable now or
in the next decade. We propose to use WFPC2 in parallel to search for a
low-surface brightness population associated with the neutral gas filaments
surrounding IC 10.

Title:	    Wind Accretion and State Transitions in the Black Hole Binary Cyg
	    X-1
PI:         Douglas Gies

The black hole binary, Cyg X-1, is generally observed in one of two long
duration X-ray states: a low flux, hard spectrum state {most common} and a
high flux, soft spectrum state. Models predict that the high/soft state
corresponds to a high mass transfer phase in the binary, and since the X-ray
source is fueled by accretion from the stellar wind of the supergiant
companion, the simple expectation is that the high/soft state results from an
increased wind mass loss rate. Alternatively, a decrease in the wind mass loss
rate could result in a more ionized and slower wind in the vicinity of the
black hole, which would then be more easily accreted by the black hole. The
best test of these hypotheses is to observe the UV P Cygni lines of the
supergiant that are formed in its wind outflow. We recently used HST/STIS to
obtain the first ever high resolution UV spectra of the system while it
resided in the high/soft state. These spectra show that the wind is
extensively ionized in the high/soft state, making the wind slower and easier
to accrete. Here we propose to revisit Cyg X-1 in the low/hard state and to
complete our investigation of the connection between the wind and the X-ray
state. The study will determine {1} the mass loss rate and the dynamical
{density and velocity} structure of the wind of the supergiant star in both
X-ray states, and {2} how the X-ray source ionizes the wind. These spectra
will be useful for other investigations and will form an important resource
for the entire research community.

Title:	    Coronagraphic imaging of Eta Corvus: a  newly discovered  debris
	    disk at 18 pc
PI:         Mark Wyatt

Debris disks are one of the final stages in the evolution of planetary
systems. High resolution imaging of debris disks has been instrumental to our
understanding of the status of planet formation in these systems. The
detection of clumps and asymmetries has even led to the detection of unseen
planets. However, just six resolved disks exist in the literature. Eta Crv is
now the seventh debris disk confirmed with imaging, and was discovered in a
recent sub-mm survey of nearby stars. Its proximity {18 pc} and similarity to
Beta Pic, one of the "big four" Vega-type disks, makes it an excellent
candidate for a high resolution coronagraphic study of its disk structure.
Modeling of this structure at many wavelengths will set hard constraints on
its unseen planetary system and the distribution of particles from micron to
kilometer in size, thus significantly extending our understanding of the
planet formation processes in debris disks

Title:	    The Masses of the Quasar Relics
PI:         Douglas Richstone

Guided by the M_bh-sigma relation, we will search for the most massive black
holes {BH} in galaxies within ~100 Mpc. Our results should {1} explore the
nature of the M_bh - sigma relation for the most massive BH; {2} identify the
local remnants of the brightest quasars, which should have larger BH masses
than any yet detected; and {3} test whether BH masses depend on the core light
profile of the host galaxy. High-mass BH are historically under-represented in
HST surveys. This proposal exploits a breakthrough - achieved by us in Cycle
10 - of using the Ca H+K region to measure stellar kinematics of
high-dispersion galaxies. This permits an extension of a factor of 2.5 in
surface brightness in the application of our well-honed observational and
theoretical tools for the estimation of BH masses. Searches for BH in galaxy
centers have led to the discoveries that {1} most or all hot galaxies contain
BHs; {2} the BH mass is well-correlated with the velocity dispersion of the
host galaxy bulge and; {3} the numbers and masses of these BH are consistent
with the quasar luminosity function and the X-ray background light. These
observations suggest a strong link between BH formation, AGN activity, and
galaxy formation and their further clarification will inform all these areas.
The high-mass end of the BH distribution represents the brightest quasars and
the most merged galaxies, but it is poorly defined. This proposal addresses
that problem.

Title:	    The HST survey of the Orion Nebula Cluster
PI:         Massimo Robberto

We propose a Treasury Program of 104 HST orbits to perform the definitive
study of the Orion Nebula Cluster, the Rosetta stone of star formation. We
will cover with unprecedented sensitivity {23-25 mag}, dynamic range {~12
mag}, spatial resolution {50mas}, and simultaneous spectral coverage {5 bands}
a ~450 square arcmin field centered on the Trapezium stars. This represents a
tremendous gain over the shallow WFC1 study made in 1991 with the aberrated
HST on an area ~15 times smaller. We maximize the HST observing efficiency
using ACS/WFC and WFPC2 in parallel with two opposite roll angles, to cover
the same total field. We will assemble the richest, most accurate and unbiased
HR diagram for pre-main-sequence objects ever made. Combined with the optical
spectroscopy already available for ~1000 sources and new deep near-IR imaging
and spectroscopy {that we propose as Joint HST-NOAO observations}, we will be
able to attack and possibly solve the most compelling questions on stellar
evolution: the calibration of pre-main-sequence evolutionary tracks, mass
segration and the variation of the initial mass function in different
environments, the evolution of mass accretion rates vs. age and environment,
disk dissipation in environments dominated by hard vs. soft-UV radiation,
stellar multiplicity vs. disk fraction. In addition, we expect to discover and
classify an unknown, but substantial, population of pre-Main Sequence
binaries, low mass stars and brown dwarfs down to ~10 MJup. This is also the
best possible way to discover dark silhouette disks in the outskirts of the
Orion Nebula and study their evolutionary status through multicolor imaging.
This program is timely and extremely well leveraged to other programs
targeting Orion: the ACS H-alpha survey of the Orion Nebula, the recently
completed 850ks ultradeep Chandra survey, the large GTO programs to be
performed with SIRTF, plus the availability of 2MASS and various deep JHK
surveys of the core recently done with 8m class telescopes.

We propose to make the first unequivocal resolved observation of a brown dwarf
binary system comprised of an L dwarf and a T dwarf. The proposed observations
will confirm the binarity of the system, measure the physical separation of
the two components, provide a robust spectral type estimate for the T dwarf
secondary, and enable the mass ratio of the system to be determined. As a
late-L/mid-T binary, the components straddle the poorly understood "L/T
transition" where a brightening of T dwarfs at J-band is observed compared to
the comparatively warmer L dwarfs. In addition to testing theories for this
brightening, these data will put strong constraints on substellar evolution
and formation models.

Title:	    Current star formation in young, compact clusters in  the Small
	    Magellanic Cloud
PI:         Antonella Nota

The Small Magellanic Cloud {SMC} offers a deep, resolved stellar population
that leverages fundamental parameters {metallicity, dust content} with respect
to the Milky Way and to its most studied counterpart, the LMC. Its subsolar
metallicity makes it the best analog to the large majority of dwarf
irregulars, and gives us the possibility to study star formation and evolution
in an enviroment with the closest {available} resemblance to the early
universe. Young, compact clusters are ideal laboratories to investigate how
these fundamental differences affect star and cluster formation and evolution.
We are therefore, proposing, to use ACS and NICMOS to perform a in depth study
of the "resolved" stellar population in the four youngest compact clusters in
the SMC. The observations, spanning the UV to the near-IR, will reach the
subsolar domain, and will address the following fundamental questions: Does
the IMF follow the universal Salpeter's law? Is mass segregation prevalent in
the SMC clusters as in LMC clusters? Is on-going star formation present, where
and how? What is the role of massive star feedback? The four proposed clusters
span an age range from 3-20 Myr, and sample spatially different regions of the
SMC. The synergy with NICMOS will permit full characterization of existing pre
main sequence stars, if detected. This proposal is part of a coordinated HST
and ground-based study of the stellar history and star formation processes in
the SMC.

Title:	    Mass Distributions of z ~ 1 Galaxies: Probing Substructure and
	    Dynamical Evidence for Bulges in Velocity Profiles
PI:         Nicole Vogt

We propose to use the unique resolving capabilities of STIS to conduct a pilot
study of the internal kinematics, structure, and star formation properties of
five spiral galaxies at redshifts z ~ 1. Our aim is to determine if these
large, rapidly rotating disks have bulges in place at this epoch, and hence
can be viewed as direct precursors to their local counterparts. The resolution
of ground-based telescopes is insufficient to resolve velocity profiles across
these galaxies on the small physical scales necessary to explore the strength
of the bulge component and the level of mass-concentration in the potential
core. STIS thus provides a unique opportunity to study the detailed kinematics
of distant galaxies, and to probe evolution in the shape of the mass
distribution. We have selected targets from a high redshift sample containing
100+ Keck+LRIS major-axis, optical rotation curves for which the [OII]3727A
optical emission line has high S/N across the disk. STIS spectroscopy will be
combined with existing LRIS spectroscopy and WFPC2, NICMOS and ground-based
photometry to derive fundamental structural parameters {rotation velocity
profile, stellar mass, mass concentration, disk scale length}, luminosities
and star formation rates, and compare them with local counterparts. This will
provide a stringent test of current scenarios for the formation of galactic
disks and bulges.

A survey of SMC planetary nebulae {PNe} is proposed to study the co-evolution
of the nebulae and their central stars, in an environment that is chemically
very metal poor. We will obtain STIS imaging and medium-resolution slitless
spectroscopy which will yield line fluxes and nebular morphologies in
important emission lines, plus magnitudes of the central stars. From these
data we will gather a harvest of information: the nebular size, morphology,
ionization structure, density, and mass; and the central star temperature,
luminosity, and mass. We will explore the correlation found in the Galaxy of
nebular bipolarity with large progenitor star mass and with chemical
enrichment of the outer envelope during the prior AGB phase. These
relationships between PN and central star evolution will be pursued in the SMC
with a sample free of distance uncertainties and selection biases, and in a
metal-poor chemical environment that stands in sharp contrast to the Galaxy
and the LMC. The importance of this program is two-fold: We will determine the
late evolutionary paths of the most common stars in a galaxy that, in its
chemical content, mimics a young galaxy; and we will produce a sample of
extragalactic PN images and spectra that will far exceed in number the
galactic PNe already observed with HST, providing an homogeneous database for
testing the evolutionary implications of metallicity variations in stellar
evolution.

Title:	    A UV Survey of Quiescent Black Holes and Neutron Stars
PI:         Robert Hynes

Existing STIS observations of quiescent Galactic black hole and neutron star
binaries suggest a striking difference between them. The spectra of black
holes appear to drop off steeply in the near-UV, whereas those of neutron
stars continue to rise, at least down to 1700A. This difference has been
interpreted in terms of advective accretion models, and may indicate a
fundamental signature of the two types of object. The existing data do not
include enough objects to form a representative sample, however. We will
exploit the faint source sensitivity of ACS to perform a survey of the UV
spectral shapes across a larger sample containing both black holes and neutron
stars. This survey will test the assertion that their UV spectra are
strikingly different; allow modelling of the broad band spectral energy
distribution; test for variability in the UV flux; and identify suitable
targets for subsequent spectroscopic follow-up..

Title:	    The Size and Shape of a Spiral Galaxy's Gaseous Halo

We propose to observe the gaseous halo of a nearby edge-on spiral galaxy using
STIS G140M {centered at 1222A and 1567A} and G230M {centered at 2828A} spectra
of 3 bright QSOs that surround it at different impact parameters and position
angles. These observations will allow us to determine the extent, metallicity,
and ionization state of the gaseous halo of a normal L* spiral galaxy for the
first time. These observations will determine whether galaxy halos: {1} have
extents consistent with the statistical measurements from QSO absorption line
number densities {50 kpc for Mg II, 100 kpc for C IV, and 250 kpc for
Ly-alpha}, {2} are round or highly flattened, and {3} have significant
metallicities {>~ 10% solar} extending up to 50 or even 100 kpc. These data
will also allow us to determine some simple kinematics for this halo gas. The
edge-on Sc galaxy ESO 157-G049 and the triple system of bright QSOs that all
probe its halo within a projected distance of 125 kpc is unique - we have
searched the entire sky for bright QSOs within 150 kpc of nearby galaxies and
no other nearby galaxies are probed by three QSOs bright enough to be observed
with HST/STIS. Our Cycle 11 snapshot program has measured accurate far-UV
fluxes for these QSOs and has already made probable detections of Ly-alpha
absorption associated with this galaxy in 2 of the QSO sight lines.

empirical test of binary star parameters in the post-AGB phase, and cannot be

We propose to double the existing information on the ionization of HeII in the
IGM at redshifts around 3. We will observe 3 QSOs that are bright in the far
UV. Each will give a moderate resolution HST spectrum better than any obtained
so far. We will also observe a fourth QSO that currently lacks high SNR
spectra. This program addresses a central issue in cosmology: the reionization
of the intergalactic medium {IGM}. Current theoretical models predict that H I
starts to reionize around z=17, completing near 6, while HeII reionization is
delayed until z=3. The theoretical models of the ionization of HeII in the IGM
now offer more detailed predictions that the data can distinguish. The new
spectra will provide the data required to distinguish between different
reionization scenarios, by increasing the number of lines of sight near z=3
with good spectra from 3 to 7, 3 of which will have the best sensitivity to
the HeII optical depth. For the first time we also explore the 3-dimensional
distribution of the ionizing regions, to characterize the luminosity and
number density of the ionizing sources.

There is mounting evidence that the redshift range 1 < z < 2 was an important

there is very little data in the optical rest frame {i.e., observed

type, in order to provide the most information about the variety of massive

large scale--length disks, stable spiral structure, mature bulges with red
stellar populations, central bar structures, the incidence of disturbed
morphology, the existence {or lack thereof} of blue ellipticals, and other
questions that concern the evolution and maturation of the brightest, largest,

PI:         Letizia Stanghellini

The final phase of the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars, the
planetary nebula {PN} ejection, is thought to largely contribute to the carbon
and nitrogen enrichment in galaxies, in particular in old stellar populations.
Stellar generations forming from a carbon- and nitrogen-enriched medium are a
necessary condition for planetary and life formation. It is essential to
understand how stars go through the process of shedding their
chemically-enriched shells, and to test the predictions of stellar evolution
theory on the relationship between stellar mass and elemental enrichment.
Magellanic Cloud PNs are ideal probes for this study. Their abundances can be
directly related to the mass of the central stars and to that of the stellar
progenitor, without the great {distance and reddening} uncertainties that
affect Galactic PNs. The UV lines are essential for calculating the abundances
of the element related to stellar evolution {C, N, O} and to progenitor
populations {e.g., Ne}. We propose to acquire STIS UV spectroscopy of the SMC
PNs whose morphology and central star properties has been previously
determined by us with HST. We will derive the {C, N, O} abundance-to-mass
relation, and determine the extent to which the mass of the progenitors of
asymmetric PNs exceed that of symmetric PNs. We will also test the PN
luminosity function, and probe cosmic recycling, in a very low-metallicity
environment.

PI:         William Harris

Evidence is mounting that the most massive globular clusters, such as Omega
Centauri and M31-G1, may be related to the recently discovered "Ultra-Compact
Dwarfs" and the dense nuclei of dE, N galaxies. However, no systematic imaging
investigation of these supermassive globular clusters -- at the level of Omega
Cen and beyond -- has been done, and we do not know what fraction of them
might bear the signatures {such as large effective radii or tidal tails} of
having originated as dE nuclei. We propose to use the ACS/WFC to obtain deep
images of 18 such clusters in NGC 5128 and M31, the two nearest rich globular
cluster systems. These globulars are the richest star clusters that can be
found in nature, the biggest of them reaching 10^7 Solar masses, and they are
likely to represent the results of star formation under the densest and most
extreme conditions known. Using the profiles of the clusters including their
faint outer envelopes, we will carry out state-of-the-art dynamical modelling
of their structures, and look for any clear evidence which would indicate that
they are associated with stripped satellites. This study will build on our
previous work with STIS and WFPC2 imaging designed to study the 'Fundamental
Plane' of globular clusters. When our new work is combined with Archival
WFPC2, STIS, and ACS material, we will also be able to construct the
definitive mapping of the Fundamental Plane of globular clusters at its
uppermost mass range, and confirm whether or not the UCD and dE, N objects

Title:	    The Formation Mechanisms of Extreme Horizontal Branch Stars
PI:         Thomas Brown

We propose far-UV spectroscopy of NGC 2808, in order to better understand the
formation mechanisms for extreme horizontal branch {EHB} stars. Our recent
analysis of STIS UV imaging has revealed an unusual population of subluminous
EHB stars in this cluster, an anomaly that is unexplained by canonical stellar
evolution theory. Using new theoretical models of evolution, atmospheres, and
spectra, we have demonstrated that these subluminous stars could be the
product of a late helium core flash, which occurs while the stars are on the
white dwarf cooling curve. The convection zone produced by such a flash will
penetrate the hydrogen envelope, mixing hydrogen into the hot helium-burning
interior, where it is rapidly consumed. The resulting EHB star would exhibit
greatly enhanced helium and carbon at its surface, and would appear
subluminous in the UV. Furthermore, the dichotomy between the normal EHB stars
and the hotter flash-mixed EHB stars would explain the hottest gap observed in
the HB distribution of NGC 2808. Far-UV spectroscopy of normal and subluminous
EHB stars in this cluster will unambiguously test this new formation
mechanism. The results will also advance our understanding of abundance
anomalies in subdwarf B and O stars, the UV emission from elliptical galaxies,
and the "born again" scenario for producing hydrogen-deficient R CrB stars.

PI:         Roberta Humphreys

The extreme RSG and powerful OH/IR source VY CMa is surrounded by an
asymmetric reflection nebula dominated by a prominent nebulous arc, bright
filamentary arcs, and several clumps of dusty knots that are evidence for
multiple and asymmetric mass loss events. Our groundbased velocities show that
these structures are kinematically distinct from the gneral flow of the
diffuse gas and may be directional. We have speculated that these arcs and
knots may be caused by localized activity on the star involving convection and
possibly magnetic fields analogous to lower mass stars. If correct this would
have important implications for the causes of high mass loss events in evolved
massive stars. Fortunately, VY CMa provides us with an opportunity to learn
more about its possible mass loss mechanisms and history from the morphology
of its ejecta. We propose to use polarimetry and second epoch images combined
with our radial velocities to map the morphology of the nebula and the
discrete structures embedded in it.

Title:	    SAINTS - Supernova 1987A INTensive Survey
PI:         Robert Kirshner

SAINTS is a program to observe SN 1987A, the brightest supernova in 383 years,
as it transforms into supernova remnant {SNR} 1987A, the youngest supernova
remnant. HST is the unique and perfect match in scale and in field for
spatially-resolved observations of SN 1987A. Rapid changes are taking place in
a violent encounter between the fastest-moving debris and the circumstellar
ring. This one-time-only event, leading to suddenly appearing hotspots and new
emission that can reveal previously hidden gas, is powered by shocks that can
be studied simultaneously with HST and with Chandra to great advantage. Both
the optical and X-ray flux from the ring are rising rapidly so prompt
observations are needed in Cycle 13. Our previous observations reveal a
remarkable reverse shock moving upstream through the expanding debris. The
reverse shock provides a powerful tool for dissecting the radial structure of
the vanished star. The debris from the explosion itself, still excited by
radioactivity, is now well resolved by ACS and seen to be aspherical,
providing direct clues to the mechanism of the explosion. Many questions about
SN 1987A remain unanswered. SAINTS is a comprehensive attempt to use HST to
establish the facts of SN 1987A, help to answer interesting questions, and to
observe the birth of SNR 1987A.

Title:	    Observing the Next Nearby Supernova
PI:         John Bahcall

If a neutrino-producing supernova {SN} explodes in the Galaxy, the Large or
Small Magellanic Clouds, or a close member of the Local Group, it will be
detected first by operating neutrino experiments: Super-Kamiokande, SNO,
MACRO, and AMANDA. The supernova neutrino early warning system will notify
photon observers throughout the world within an hour of the neutrino
detection. Although the per-year probability of observing a neutrino SN
{within 100 kpc} is small, the detection would be importantly scientifically
and of widespread interest. The optical counterpart could be much brighter
than normal extragalactic SNe. A bright nearby supernova detected by other
means would also be of great interest and should activate this proposal. We
propose unique STIS ultraviolet spectroscopic observations to measure the
principal metallic lines, and hence the composition, velocity, and physical
state, of the outermost atmosphere of the exploded star. In addition, we
propose narrow- and broad-band imaging to provide information about the
stellar environment and early morphology unobtainable from the ground. The
data, especially images, will be valuable for public outreach and will be
released immediately by NASA.

Title:	    The Formation History of Andromeda
PI:         Thomas Brown

We propose deep observations of Andromeda's outer disk and giant tidal stream,
to reconstruct their star formation histories. As the nearest giant galaxy,
Andromeda offers the best testing ground for understanding galaxy formation
and evolution. Given the dramatic increase in sensitivity offered by the ACS,
we can now resolve stars on the old main sequence in the other giant spiral of
the Local Group, and employ the same direct age diagnostics that have been
used for decades in the study of Galactic globular clusters. In Cycle 11, we
successfully observed a field in the Andromeda halo and constructed a deep
color-magnitude diagram reaching well below the oldest main sequence turnoff.
In Cycle 13, we propose to extend these observations to the outer disk and
tidal stream of Andromeda, to constrain their star formation histories and
compare them to that of the halo. The combined observations from these two
programs will offer a dramatic advance in our understanding of the overall
evolution of spiral galaxies.

Title:	    Origins of the Highly Ionized Gas toward the X-ray Bright BL Lac
	    Object Mrk 421
PI:         Blair Savage

The X-ray bright BL Lac object Mrk 421 is one of the small number of
extragalactic objects for which it is possible to study the highly ionized gas
in the ISM and Local Group using the full diagnostic power of UV, far-UV and
X-ray observatories. High quality far-UV observations of OVI and other ions
have been obtained by FUSE, whereas Chandra and XMM-Newton have provided X-ray
measurements of extremely strong OVII and OVIII absorption at redshift zero.
It has been proposed that the OVI, OVII, and OVIII originate together in the
warm-hot intergalactic medium, of the kind predicted by numerical simulations
to contain a substantial fraction of the baryons at z=0. However, the
properties of the high-ion absorption are also consistent with an origin in an
extended Galactic Corona. Data for other species such as SiIII, SiIV, and CIV
will be essential to determine whether or not a Local Group WHIM filament has
been detected. These species are not expected to be seen in a hot {T > 10^6 K}
medium and their detection at the same velocity as OVI would suggest that the
OVI samples a different phase of the gas than the OVII and OVIII. We propose
to obtain a high quality 7 km/s resolution STIS UV spectrum of Mrk 421 from
1150 to 1700 A. The STIS measurements of CII, CIV, SiIII, SiIV, and other
species will allow us to evaluate the ionization conditions in the absorbing
gas in the Galactic thick disk and in an anomalous high positive velocity
absorption wing currently only traced by OVI and CIII. The ionic ratios among
these species will provide critical tests of the ionization mechanisms
affecting the OVI absorption.

Title:	    The Shadow Echoes of the Unique R Coronae Borealis Star, UW Cen
PI:         Geoffrey Clayton

Understanding the R Coronae Borealis {RCB} stars is a key test for any theory
aiming to explain hydrogen deficiency in post-AGB stars. The RCB stars are
rare hydrogen-deficient carbon-rich supergiants that undergo very spectacular
declines in brightness of up to 8 magnitudes at irregular intervals as dust
forms near the star along the line of sight. UW Cen is unique among the cool
RCB stars in having a visible circumstellar shell. The morphology of the
nebula appears to change as different parts are illuminated by light from the
central star modulated by shifting, thick dust clouds near its surface. The
central star acts like a "lighthouse, " shining through gaps between the
near-star dust clouds, and lighting up different portions of the outer nebula.
We propose a scientific program in which a small number of observations using
ACS/HRC will exploit UW Cen's unique circumstellar shell to address two
critical elements in understanding RCB stars: determining an accurate distance
to the star, and studying the otherwise unobservable dust clouds forming near
the star's surface. We will model the images using Monte Carlo techniques to
calculate the radiative transfer through arbitrary distributions of dust
viewed from any angle.

Title:	    Recovery of three faint Kuiper Belt Objects discovered with HST
PI:         David Trilling

We propose 6 orbits to make ACS/WFC follow-up observations of three faint
Kuiper Belt Objects {KBOs} that we discovered in the Large Cycle 11 program GO
9433 {G. Bernstein, PI; Bernstein et al. 2004}. These KBOs are the faintest --
and therefore smallest -- KBOs known. Two of these objects can be recovered
{and the third easily recovered and its colors probed} only with HST. Any
future studies of small KBOs will require knowledge of our three faint KBOs.
With the proposed observations, the locations of these KBOs will be known
quite well until after first light for JWST. Without the proposed
observations, these three small KBOs will be effectively lost. This small
program represents a small investment of HST time to solidify the legacy of
the Bernstein et al. Large GO program. With the proposed observations, we will
be able to determine with certainty the dynamical classes of these three KBOs,
testing the hypothesis that small KBOs are predominantly classical KBOs. We
will also test the suggestion that classical KBOs are uniformly quite red.
Lastly, our observations will enable physical studies {e.g., spectroscopy}
with JWST a decade from now. All these measurements will provide important
evidence for theories on the formation and evolution of the Solar System.

PI:         John Spencer

We propose disk-resolved 2000-3150 A spectroscopy of Io's unique SO2
atmosphere in order to test the relative importance of volcanism and frost
sublimation in supporting the atmosphere. This is important for answering such
basic questions as the extent to which the atmosphere collapses at night. If
it does collapse, it is the only substantial atmosphere in the solar system to
behave in this manner. Our observations will target low-latitude regions away
from active plumes {in contrast to our Cycle 10 observations which targeted
the Prometheus plume}, to look for the effect of plumes on the atmosphere. We
will also look at the variation of low-latitude atmospheric abundance with
terrain type, to look for explanations for the large longitudinal variations
in atmospheric pressure seen in earlier data. Finally, we will look at a
variety of regions at two different times of day to determine the extent of
diurnal variations in the atmosphere, which are expected if the atmosphere is
dominantly supported by frost sublimation.

We plan a single-orbit observation of Titan to observe the 387nm CN emission

methane-rich nitrogen atmosphere. The observation may confirm the entry time
of the probe, and provide constraints on the nonthermal emission from the
shock layer and wake for an entry body of known ballistic parameters to aid
aerothermodynamic models to aid meteoric studies and future heat shield
designs. Whether the entry is detected or not, the observation also yields a
north-south spectral profile to diagnose the continuing seasonal change on
Titan, namely the north-south seasonal asymmetry, and the disappearing UV-dark
south polar hood. Near-IR STIS Spectra, nominally before and after the probe
entry, will constrain the stratospheric and tropospheric haze and cloud

cavity driven into the disc edge by the accretion stream from the mass donor
star. This {literal} probe is so far unique. At the orbital phase when we look
into the hot cavity, the emission from the cavity should be a significant
fraction of the total UV flux. Comparison with our hydrodynamic simulations of
the stream-disc impact will allow us to determine the structure of the cool
quiescent outer disc. We will fully characterise the white dwarf, measuring
its rotation rate, surface gravity, effective temperature, chemical
abundances, accretion rate and gravitational redshift. The obscuration of the
inner UV emitting regions by vertical structure associated with spiral density
waves will be measured and interpreted by comparison with our simulations. The
observations will be performed in the CVZ.

Title:	    A Snapshot Survey of the Sites of Recent, Nearby Supernovae
PI:         Alex Filippenko

During the past few years, robotic {or nearly robotic} searches for supernovae
{SNe}, most notably our Lick Observatory Supernova Search {LOSS}, have found
hundreds of SNe, many of them in quite nearby galaxies {cz < 4000 km/s}. Most
of the objects were discovered before maximum brightness, and have follow-up
photometry and spectroscopy; they include some of the best-studied SNe to
date. We propose to conduct a snapshot imaging survey of the sites of some of
these nearby objects, to obtain late-time photometry that {through the shape
of the light and color curves} will help reveal the origin of their lingering
energy. The images will also provide high-resolution information on the local
environment of SNe that are far superior to what we can procure from the
ground. For example, we will obtain color-color and color-magnitude diagrams
of stars in these SN sites, to determine their progenitor masses and
constraints on the reddening. Recovery of the SNe in the new HST images will
also allow us to actually pinpoint their progenitor stars in cases where
pre-explosion images exist in the HST archive. Use of ACS rather than WFPC2
will make our snapshot survey even more valuable than our Cycle 9 survey. This
Proposal is complementary to our Cycle 13 archival proposal, in which we
outline a plan for using existing HST images to glean information about SN
environments.

Title:	    Accurately Mapping M31's Microlensing Population
PI:         Arlin Crotts

We propose to augment an existing microlensing survey of M31 with source
identifications provided by a modest amount of ACS {and WFPC2 parallel}
observations to yield an accurate measurement of the masses responsible for
microlensing in M31, and presumably much of its dark matter. The main benefit
of these data is the determination of the physical {or "einstein"} timescale
of each microlensing event, rather than an effective {"FWHM"} timescale,
allowing masses to be determined more than twice as accurately as without HST
data. The einstein timescale is the ratio of the lensing cross-sectional
radius and relative velocities. Velocities are known from kinematics, and the
cross-section is directly proportional to the {unknown} lensing mass. We
cannot easily measure these quantities without knowing the amplification,
hence the baseline magnitude, which requires the resolution of HST to find the
source star. This makes a crucial difference because M31 lens m ass
determinations can be more accurate than those towards the Magellanic Clouds
through our Galaxy's halo {for the same number of microlensing events} due to
the better constrained geometry in the M31 microlensing situation.
Furthermore, our larger survey, just completed, should yield at least 100 M31
microlensing events, more than any Magellanic survey. A small amount of
ACS+WFPC2 imaging will deliver the potential of this large database {about 350
nights}. For the whole survey {and a delta-function mass distribution} the
mass error should approach only about 15%, or about 6% error in slope for a
power-law distribution. These results will better allow us to pinpoint the
lens halo fraction, and the shape of the halo lens spatial distribution, and
allow generalization/comparison of the nature of halo dark matter in spiral
galaxies. In addition, we will be able to establish the baseline magnitude for
about 50, 000 variable stars, as well as measure an unprecedentedly deta iled
color-magnitude diagram and luminosity function over much of M31.

Title:	    Prospecting for Rare Elements in the Interstellar Medium
PI:         James Lauroesch

The complex history and evolution of element production is reflected in the
abundance ratios of the elements. The distinctive abundances patterns produced
by nucleosynthesis in supernovae and stars can be used to explore the history
of star formation and evolution in galaxies. Recent observations of damped
Lyman-alpha systems have suggested that observations of r and s-process
elements at high redshifts may soon provide a new window to explore chemical
evolution. Paradoxically, we may soon have more detections of some elements in
the interstellar medium of these high redshift galaxies than in the Galactic
ISM. However, without an understanding of the depletion behavior of these
elements based upon observations of nearby sightlines we may be unable to
correctly disentangle the effects of dust depletion and nucleosynthesis. We
therefore propose to determine the depletion of r and s-process elements in
two sightlines with relatively mild depletion patterns on nearly opposite
parts of the sky. In addition to providing a baseline for studies at high
redshift, the long pathlength studied will enable us to search for abundance
variations within our Galaxy.

PI:         Mark Showalter

Last year, our Uranian ring and moon observing program {GO-9823} resulted in
the discovery of two moons, S/2003 U 1 and S/2003 U 2. We imaged two
additional small moons, Ophelia and S/1986 U 10, that had not been seen since
the Voyager encounter of 1986. Furthermore, our data show faint arcs and
clumps orbiting within the rings, which were not seen by Voyager and are
completely unexpected. We employed several "tricks" of the HRC to achieve this
remarkable senstivity; specifically, we used the CLEAR filter and oriented the
images so that the planet, though vastly overexposed, did not interfere with
the ring/moon region of interest to us. This allowed us to detect
25th-magnitude moons circling a 5th-magnitude planet. Now we propose to
complete the task by carrying out a comprehensive survey of the system using
the same techniques. Our goals are to recover the moons, better discern their
orbital elements, and learn more about the dynamics of the ring clumps. In
particular, we need to {1} understand the long-term stability of S/2003 U 2,
which orbits perilously close to the larger moon Belinda; {2} complete our
search for moons, which was only ~ 50% complete last year, and {3} better
understand how the clumps and arcs within the ring system might relate to
nearby "shepherding" moons, seen or unseen.

Six quasars lie between 1 and 4.2 Holmberg radii near the major axis on the

farther out on the southwest side of the major axis. One lies within 1
Holmberg radius. Two of the 10 pass through M31's high velocity clouds
recently seen in a detailed 21 cm emission map. Thus, using the most
well-studied external spiral galaxy in the sky, our observations will permit
us to check, better than ever before, the standard picture that quasar
metal-line absorption systems arise in an extended gaseous halo/disk of a
galaxy well beyond its observable optical radius. Notably, the observations

so stars will be grouped into cases having different levels of general
depletion and then within each category the spectra will be coadded to enhance
the detectability of the lines. These data will be combined with results
derived by S. Cartledge and coworkers on O and Kr, plus data soon to be

behavior of depletions of atoms onto dust grains under different conditions,

temperature, and ionization structure of gas in the leading arm of the

surrounding halo gas, the results will have implications for the physical
conditions of the Galactic halo as well. We will apply the following
diagnostics to the absorption lines in archival STIS spectra: {1} thermal
pressure from C I fine-structure excitation, {2} density constraints from C
II*, {3} electron density and temperature from ionization balance, and {4}
ionization structure and density constraints from photoionization models. With
these physical conditions measurements, we will learn about the nature of O
VII and high-velocity O VI absorbers, the evolution of satellite galaxies that
pass close to the Milky Way, and whether theoretical work on the ISM in the
Milky Way halo agrees with observations. We will also learn about

Title:	    Evolution of Stars and Stellar Systems. I. The Initial Size
	    Distribution of Clusters
PI:         Rupali Chandar

There are three fundamental properties which define a star cluster -- age,
mass, and size. While much attention has been focused on the first two
parameters, significantly less is known concerning not only actual cluster
sizes and structures, but the initial distribution of stellar clustering which
occurs in different environments. For example, NGC 1569 has formed three
compact, massive young clusters in the last 10 Myr, while IZw18 appears to
have only formed more diffuse, "scaled up" OB associations {SOBAs}. The HST
archive now contains sufficient observations of nearby star-forming galaxies
to allow a quantitative measure of the initial clustering of star formation.
We propose to measure the distribution of the physical scales of cluster
formation, from the most compact clusters to diffuse SOBAs in 30 nearby
galaxies. Local variations in the star formation rate may manifest themselves
in the fraction of star formation occuring in compact clusters vs. that
occurring in more diffuse OB associations. Because our galaxy sample covers a
large range in environment, mass, and star formation rate density, we will
take the next step, and use our size distributions to place constraints on the
processes responsible for setting the scales of star formation in the local
universe. A complementary proposal aims to study the isolated red supergiant
population in nearby star-forming galaxies {PI: Dr. C. Leitherer}.

HST observations of UV emission- and absorption-line spectra in AGN indicate
the presence of highly structured outflows, characterized by complex
large-scale flow patterns and small-scale clumpiness. These outflows are best
explained as winds coming off accretion disks around supermassive black holes,
propelled and shaped by a combination of line-radiation pressure and
hydromagnetic forces. We propose to make the first comprehensive study of
hybrid radiative/hydromagnetic winds in the context of AGN flows. We will
particularly focus on a new class of instabilties,
"radiative-magnetoacoustic'' modes, that show great promise for explaining
both the global properties of the winds {velocity fields, mass loss rates} as
well as the small-scale clumpiness. Our results will be fed into a 3D

We propose to analyze NICMOS observations of the central 5 pc of the Milky Way
Galaxy in order to identify the nature of X-ray sources recently detected in a
deep set of Chandra observations. We plan to determine the relative numbers of
high-mass X-ray binaries with characteristic ages of 10^7 years, and
magnetically accreting cataclysmic variables with ages of over 10^9 years. The
results will provide information about the recent star formation history, the
propensity for binaries to form, and the mass of stellar remnants at the

Title:	    Probing the Dynamics and Shock Physics of the Cas A Supernova
	    Remnant
PI:         Robert Fesen

Cassiopeia A {Cas A; SN 1680} is the youngest known and closest example of an
oxygen-rich, core-collapse supernova remnant. A two-year WFPC2 survey of part
of the remnant yielded many new insights including realization of the stunning
amount of fine-scale detail present in the ejecta, and the first precise
location of the reverse shock front in the main shell via rapid emission and
structural changes visible over 2 yrs. In addition, these data revealed over
100 new ejecta knots located out ahead of the forward blast wave in a small
region where only a handful were known from ground-based images. We propose a
follow-up survey program aimed at obtaining hi-res images of the entire
remnant in the ejecta's four major emission lines. A separate set of ACS and
NIC3 [Si VI] images of the NW reverse shock filaments will be taken 3-4 months
following the main Cycle 12 survey images. These will allow us to the trace
individual ejecta knot deceleration dynamics, excitation, and evolution during
reverse shock passage. Analysis of the emission line fluxes will make use of
custom shock models generated by us for Cas A. These data will also provide
data on outer knot chemistry and expansion asymmetries particularly in regard
to the collimation of the NE and SW jets of O, Si, Ca-rich ejecta. A major aim
of this program is to acquire a superb two-year image database covering the
entire remnant to allow a detailed shock physics and dynamics study.

Title:	    Stars in Extended HI Disk Galaxies
PI:         Holland Ford

Half of gas rich galaxies have HI disks extending well beyond their optical
extents. This gas is a significant potential fuel repository for future star
formation. How can galaxies can store such quantities of ISM without any
apparent star formation? These extended gas disks have well maintained
velocity dispersions and dynamical structure. What is keeping them warm?
Perhaps there is star formation, but at such low levels it is not readily
apparent. We have begun investigating this problem by looking for low-level
star formation in extended HI disk galaxies. Our first target was the
spectacularly dark matter dominated galaxy NGC2915. In this case our
hypothesis was proven to be correct. We found indications for low level star
formation in two ways. {1} Our ACS WFC images show a noticeable blue plume of
stars in the g vs g-V as well as the V vs V-I color magnitude diagrams. The
blues stars extend over the full area of the WFC and are highly clumped. {2}
Previous deep Halpha images shows a few very faint HII regions near the
Holmberg radius. The weakness of the HII regions and the large numbers of blue
{B} stars suggests that the IMF is truncated at the upper end compared to
typical IMF parameterizations. This could imply that H-alpha surveys
underestimate the true star formation rate. Another surprising result of the
ACS observations is that the old population also extends well passed the
Holmberg radius and includes globular clusters. We propose to observe a second
galaxy for this program - NGC4789A {DDO154}. Like NGC2915, it also has HI
extending more than five times the Holmberg radius in a fairly well ordered
disk. In this case the old stellar population is comparetively weak, and the
foreground reddening is much less. This second set of observations will give
us a check on the generality of the NGC2915 results. In particular an IMF that
does not extend up to O star formation could have major implications for metal
production, kinetic energy release and ionization of the intergalactic medium.

We will compute traditional line statistics, but more importantly we will
compute a number of pixel statistics using the same analysis methods used by
groups that simulate the Lyman alpha forest. Examples of the pixel statistics
include the flux power spectrum, the distribution of flux per pixel, and the
mean flux decrement of the Lyman alpha forest. The results will enable for the
first time a detailed comparison between data and theory at z < 1.7. Specific
scientific issues that will be addressed with the results of this research
include {1} The spatial structure of the IGM, {2} The thermo-dynamical state
of the IGM, {3} The intensity and evolution of the UV background, and {4} The

Title:	    The Astrophysics of Heterogeneous {Clumpy} Stellar Outflows
PI:         Adam Frank

HST imaging has revealed many circumstellar environments to consist of highly
inhomogeneous media. The presence of such "clumpy" mass distributions will
have significant consequences for large-scale flows such as mass loss from
young and evolved stars as well as strong shocks propagating through
interstellar clouds. While clumping can cause dramatic changes in the
properties of such flows there remains a fundemental gap between the
relatively few theoretical studies of large scale clumpy flow systems and
observational interpretations. In this proposal we outline a theoretical study
of clumpy flows in circumstellar outflows using a new, advanced adaptive mesh
refinement numerical code known as AstroBEAR. This tool is being developed to
handle multi-physics astronomical phenomena {situations in which many physical
processes such as magnetic fields, ionization, chemistry, and radiation
transport must be simultaneously simulated}. Our study will provide
unparalleled resolution to study the radiative gasdynamic, magneto-gasdynamic
and photo-ionization evolution of heterogeneous flows. The code will track
ionization and micro-physical states in the flow allowing detailed comparison
with HST observations of YSO jets and Planetary Nebulae. We plan to apply the
code to the observations of clumpy bow shocks and internal working surfaces in
HH 1-2, HH34, and HH46/47. We will also conduct studies relevent to the
stellar wind blown bubble PNe systems NGC 2392 and NGC 6751.

Title:	    Constraints on galaxy formation models from size evolution of

PI:         Rachel Somerville

The radial sizes of disks and spheroids are fundamental properties of
galaxies, and must be connected with the efficiency of star formation, yet
neither numerical nor semi-analytic galaxy formation models are currently able
to model them accurately. We propose to compile measurements of disk and
spheroid sizes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey {SDSS}, Great Observatories
Origins Deep Survey {GOODS}, and GEMS {Galaxy Evolution from Morphology and
SED} survey to characterize in a single consistent analysis the evolution of
galaxy sizes from z=5 to the present. We will confront these observations with
predictions from three different paradigms of galaxy evolution: {1} a
no-evolution model {2} a backwards-evolution model and {3} a hierarchical
model based on semi-analytic techniques. For {3}, we will develop new
physically motivated modeling of the sizes of disks and spheroids, which has
not previously been done self-consistently in a semi-analytic model set within
the complete framework of the Cold Dark Matter merging hierarchy. We will
account for the formidable selection and measurement biases and cosmic
variance by creating synthetic images based on each model paradigm, and
running the actual object detection and structural fitting software on these
images to create mock catalogs of "observed" galaxy properties. We will use
Bayesian methods to quantify the parts of parameter space that are favored
within each paradigm, and to assess which model paradigm is favored overall by
the data. By carrying out this program, we hope to gain insight into the
physical origin of observed galaxy sizes and fundamental scaling relations and
their evolution through cosmic history.

PI:         Farhad Yusef-Zadeh

We believe that the Galactic center provides the best opportunity for
investigating the distribution of stars and gas in the immediate vicinity of a
supermassive black hole, at a level of detail that will not be accessible in
any other galactic nucleus. We propose to utilize approximately 150 HST NICMOS
archival images to investigate the nature of the surface brightness
distribution within the inner few tens of arcseconds of the Galactic center.
In particular, we will examine the claim that there is a deficiency of stars
within the inner 1 arcsecond of Sgr A*. This could be evidence of the core
radius of the nuclear stellar distribution or it might be due to the depletion
of late-type stars with high mass-to-light ratios. Yet another possibility is
ejection of stars from the central 1 arcsecond by a past or present binary
black hole.

allow us to make the most effective use of the HST data.

photometry and high quality Keck spectroscopy. The overall goal is to
correlate the dynamical and photometric properties of disks and bulges in the
context of popular models for galaxy assembly. The resolved colors and
physical scales of bulges in the redshift range 0.3<z<0.5 will be combined
with dynamical masses to determine whether bulges represent systems that are
continuously forming to the present epoch. The scale-lengths, color-uniformity
and morphologies of a mass-selected sample of >100 z=1 disks will be analyzed
with extended rotation curves to address the important question of whether
stellar disks were mature and established at early epochs. The program
represents a concerted attempt to address the origin of key components which

These data span 16 epochs between 1994 Feb and 2002 May in six broad-, one
medium- and three narrow-band filters with total exposure times ranging from
1.3--11.4 hours. This dataset will be used to: 1} map out the faintest
line-emitting structures in the photoionized bipolar circumstellar nebula
surrounding SN 1987A, 2} generate fading lightcurves and
[OIII]/{H-alpha+[NII]} line emission maps of the various component
substructures of this nebula, 3} establish a highly-accurate astrometric grid
of stars within 20 arcseconds of SN 1987A, 4} generate very deep
{m~25.5--26.5} broad-band photometry of these same LMC field stars, and 5}
identify any variable stellar sources in the field. Additionally, we would
seek to register and stack the surrounding WF chip images, extending the
stellar and ISM field out to 2 arcminute radius. Once we have accomplished our
goals we will make these images publically available. Further science that
would be available from these publicly-released deep field images includes: 1}
a deep map of LMC interstellar line emission unrelated to SN 1987A, which can
be correlated with other imaging and spectroscopic datasets, 2} a small, but

Title:	    The Escape of Oxygen from Mars
PI:         Jody Wilson

This proposal is to perform detailed analysis of STIS observations of the
upper atmosphere of Mars, using an ionospheric model, general circulation
model results for the neutral atmosphere, and various recent spacecraft
observations of Mars. The end goal is to better understand the escape of
oxygen, and by extension water, from Mars. The observations have yielded limb
profiles of atomic hydrogen, atomic oxygen, and carbon monoxide with 24 km
vertical resolution and a field of view that is thousands of km long. Most of
the hydrogen and some of the oxygen atoms thus detected are escaping from
Mars. There are no other measurements of volatiles escaping from Mars with
nearly such high spatial resolution and large field of view. The data analysis
in the original observing proposal will derive spatially-averaged escape rates
of hydrogen and possibly oxygen at the time of the observations. This archival
research will go beyond that analysis by investigating how the escaping
species diffused through the upper atmosphere to reach the exobase and
relating these observations of current escape rate to the time history of
escape. The escape of water from Mars has had a major impact on its climate
history, the understanding of which is a major scientific goal of NASA's
Office of Space Science.

Title:	    Searching for Quasar-Intrinsic Absorption Through Time Variability
PI:         Rajib Ganguly

We propose to use multi-epoch, low-resolution spectra of quasars from the HST
archive to look for narrow absorption lines that exhibit time variability.
This is an economical test for identifying absorbers that are intrinsic to the
quasar central engine, and also provides constraints on the density an/or
location of the gas. Narrow absorption lines {NALs} which appear in the
spectra of quasars are very powerful tool to diagnose the physical conditions
{e.g., ionization, geometry} from a variety of structures, ranging from the
ISM of the Galaxy, to the central engine of the quasar. The primary signatures
that distinguish intrinsic NALs from intervening NALs are partial coverage of
the background source and time variability. The former requires high spectral
resolution which can be observationally expensive. We have completed a pilot
study using associated NALs {those which appear near the quasar redshift} and
have devised an approach to efficiently select time-variable absorption using
multi-epoch spectra from different instruments. We wish to expand our search
to the ~100 quasars that have archived multi-epoch low-resolution spectra. The
quasars span a large range of redshifts and luminosity, and the proposed study
will allow us to select low- and high-velocity intrinsic NALs. Furthermore, we
can decipher the underlying cause of the variability - bulk motion of the gas,
or ionization changes - which have differing observational signatures.

Title:	    The Local Environments of Supernovae
PI:         Schuyler Van Dyk

The locations of supernovae {SNe} in the local stellar and gaseous environment
in galaxies, as measured in high spatial resolution WFPC2 and ACS images,
contain important clues to their progenitor stars. They provide accurate
determinations of any association of SNe with H II regions or star clusters.
In cases where multi-filter observations are available, we can determine the
local stellar population, setting constraints on the mass of the progenitor,
we can also search for possible attenuation of the SN by dust in the host
galaxy by studying the colors of the stars in its environment. By checking the
fields for background sources, we can correct the existing SN light curves and
luminosities if necessary. When a SN has been observed incidentally,
information can be gained on its optical and UV emission. Deep HST images can
be used to find light echoes of SNe, as well as recover SNe interacting with
circumstellar material at very late times. A direct search for the progenitor
stars of SNe can be made in pre-existing HST images of their locations; as the
number of archival HST images steadily increases, along with the number of
newly discovered SNe, positive identifications become progressively more
likely. In Cycle 13, we plan to extend our successful work from previous
cycles. A major improvement is that very good ground-based coordinates are now
available for numerous recent SNe.

aspect of the Archival ACS data. {2} Apply a fully two dimensional Fourier

to trace to formation of the present day Hubble sequence. {3} Use the deeper

We propose to carefully measure the morphology of z=5.7, narrow band selected
Lyman Alpha emitters in the GOODS-S and UDF fields. The candidate objects will
be selected using existing observations of these fields taken from the ground,
under sub arcsecond seeing conditions, and using two narrow band filters {823
nm and 815nm}. While the number of detections of high redshift Lyman Alpha
sources has been steadily increasing in the past year, very little is known
about the source of the Lyman Alpha emission. The observed high Lyman Alpha
equivalent widths of these objects have been explained using a variety of
scenarios such as extreme youth of the stellar population, zero metallicity
objects, energetic winds or type II quasars. Studying the morphology of these
objects should provide us with a unique opportunity to differentiate between
several processes believed to be behind the observed Lyman Alpha emission.
Recently, and soon to be made, public HST ACS observations of the GOODS/UDF
fields, with their high angular resolutions and its well calibrated, stable
PSF provide us with a unique opportunity to study the clumpiness and spatial
extension of these objects.

Strong evidence indicates that the primary lensing galaxies in many
gravitational lens systems are associated with compact groups. We are taking
advantage of this association to conduct an active ground-based program to
find galaxy groups at moderate redshifts. Because the lens galaxies are
typically in the redshift range of 0.3<z<1.0, we can use the lenses to find
groups at redshifts at which most other group-search methods are no longer
feasible. Our ground-based wide-area {10'x10'} multicolor images, obtained at
Palomar and Keck, are used to select targets for spectroscopy. We have an
ongoing spectroscopic follow-up program at Keck and have spectroscopically
confirmed three new lens-associated groups. We have already obtained
spectroscopic data on five additional lens fields, and have been granted two
Keck nights this semester to observe ~5 more fields. Our ground-based imaging
covers 21 lens fields in total. We are proposing to combine the extensive
database of HST images of lens fields with our existing ground-based data. The
HST data will allow us to determine the morphological composition of the
members of these moderate-redshift groups, to study how the galaxy population
has evolved with time, to search for direct evidence of galaxy-galaxy mergers
and interactions, and to compare galaxy evolution in groups and rich clusters.

Title:	    PROBING THE NATURE OF DARK MATTER USING CLUSTER LENSING
PI:         Priya Natarajan

The detection of gravitational lensing of distant galaxies by foreground
galaxies has been used in recent years to set constraints on the masses and
sizes of the galaxy halos. The same technique has been successfully applied to
galaxies in the dense environments of massive X-ray clusters. These studies
point to a smaller spatial extent for the dark matter halos of cluster
galaxies compared to equivalent luminosity field galaxies due to tidal
truncation inside a cluster . The size distribution of these tidally truncated
radii can be used to probe the nature of dark matter composing these halos by
making assumptions about the dynamics and detailed shape of the gravitational
potential of the cluster. The use of simplifying theoretical assumptions have
enabled placing conservative upper limits on the cross-section for fluid-like
dark matter {FDM}. The goal of this project is to develop a more robust
theoretical framework utilizing cluster models derived from cosmological
N-body simulations that will provide stronger constraints on the nature and
interaction cross-section of dark matter. This technique when bolstered with
numerical models of clusters offers a unique and complementary way to
constrain the equation of state of DM, and constrain the parameter space of
viable candidates.

It is well known that outflows from planetary and proto-planetary nebulae
often exhibit axial symmetry. What is less well known are the *departures*
from axial symmetry, which need to be investigated if we are to have a
complete understanding of how planetary nebulae form and evolve. A study of
the departures is very timely, as 3D hydrodynamic numerical simulations are
now being developed. The HST archive contains ~3000 exposures of >400
different galactic planetary or proto-planetary nebulae. By measuring the
departures from axisymmetry for these targets, we will learn how the
departures are related to, and caused by, the physical and dynamical
conditions of the nebulae and central stars. We will produce a catalog for the
community that includes classifications and comparisons of the departures, and
correlations with physical and dynamical properties. We will apply our results
to departures from axisymmetry observed in PNe and in other types of objects,
e.g., SN 1987A, Eta Carinae. We have measured asymmetries for a few sample
objects; so we know we will obtain reliable, quantitative results that we {and
others} will use to understand the origin of the departures from axisymmetry
in a variety of objects. Long after our work on this project ends, the catalog

PI:         Daniel Proga

We propose to continue our study of outflows from active galactic nuclei
{AGN}. This phenomenon has been extensively observed with HST as well as
modeled. The overall result from previous studies, including our own ongoing
HST program, is that broad absorption lines {BAL} in QSOs can be well
understood and reproduced within the framework of radiation-driven disk wind
models. It is also very likely that the same model is capable of explaining
broad emission lines. However, this model is less successful in explaining
narrow absorption lines {NAL} observed in Seyfert galaxies. Therefore, we
propose to extend the model by including magnetic field effects. Hydromagnetic
propulsion is a likely mechanism responsible for producing low velocity
outflows from larger radii and thus explaining NAL and their lack of
short-term variability. We will continue to use the multi-dimensional,
time-dependent, magnetohydrodynamical code ZEUS to compute the wind structure.
We will also compute synthetic line profiles and continuum spectra based on
the theoretical model and compare the results with HST/STIS and other
observations. In general, we propose to follow the procedure which we
successfully applied to winds in cataclysmic variables and BAL QSOs.

Title:	    Archival Study of Merger-Induced Populations in Early-Type Galaxy
	    Cores
PI:         Jodie Martin

Hierarchical formation models predict that early-type galaxies are built up
over an extended period from mergers of smaller systems, a process which
should leave long-lived signatures in their light profiles and stellar
population colors. Merger events should have continued up to relatively recent
times {the last 1-5 Gyr}, and many ellipticals and S0 bulges should therefore
show evidence of multiple, discrete, intermediate-age populations. Although
there is substantial observational support for a dissipational merger origin
for some early-type galaxies, most do not exhibit the expected anomalies in
either their light profiles or color distributions. However, existing searches
have primarily been monochromatic and those which used multi-bands studied
only narrowly defined subsamples of early-type galaxies. Here we propose an
archival study of high resolution, broad-band, multi-color images of the cores
of a large sample of 167 early-type galaxies which are representative of the
general population. This is the most extensive search intended to probe
spatially-segregated, multiple population components with ages in the range
1-5 Gyr. Our sample consists of early-type galaxies in a wide range of
environments from the field to groups to rich clusters. There is very little
information on the color structure of core stellar populations of early-type
galaxies in different environments and how they may relate to gaseous merger
histories and our program would effectively explore new terrain. Simulations
of mergers show that gas generally falls deep into the potential well to
scales within a few 100 pc of the center before forming stars. An effective
search for distinct populations must therefore be able to resolve these
scales, which is possible for a meaningfully large sample only with HST.

Title:	    Photo- and Spectro-Chemical Evolution Models for Starburst
	    Galaxies
PI:         Gerardo Vazquez

We propose to develop new chemically consistent evolutionary synthesis models
for young stellar populations containing massive stars, including Wolf-Rayet
stars. Such populations are the powering sources of starburst galaxies at low
and high redshift and are major chemical pollutants of the interstellar and
intergalactic medium. The new models are based on the successful Starburst99
code, which will be expanded to allow for stellar evolution at arbitrary {not
discrete} chemical composition, including metallicity zero. We will supplement
our current grid of stellar models by newly developed evolutionary tracks with
rotation. The chemical evolution models will not make the instantaneous
recycling approximation and will account for infall and outflows. Existing
chemical evolution models do either have to rely on these assumptions or, if
they do not, their adopted stellar models make them inapplicable to young
massive populations.

I propose to establish SLACR, the Simulation Lyman Alpha Comparison
Repository. SLACR is a publically-accessible full-service website containing
the data and software tools necessary to generate and analyze artificial Lyman
alpha forest spectra drawn from state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations. These artificial spectra can be analyzed alongside ultraviolet
quasar and AGN spectra taken using e.g. HST/STIS, in order to {1} Test current
theories of the IGM; {2} Constrain the physical state of absorbing gas seen in
quasar spectra; {3} Assess biases and uncertainties due to sample
incompleteness, continuum fitting, and Voigt profile fitting; {4} Constrain
physical and cosmological parameters of the IGM from absorption line data; and
{5} Study the relationship between IGM absorbers and large-scale structure as
traced by galaxies. SLACR will be an invaluable model comparison and data
interpretation tool for HST observers studying the Lyman alpha forest,
associated metal absorption systems, "missing baryons" and the warm-hot
intergalactic medium, and galaxy-absorber correlations.

This sample of galaxies falls in a range of masses and morphologies neglected
by previous studies. Analysis of this sample will enable us to study
variations in globular cluster system properties and their correlation with
galaxy mass and morphology. Specifically, we will be able to address the
correlation of metal-rich clusters with bulge mass, the possible increase of
specific frequencies at lower galaxy masses and the galaxy mass dependence of
globular cluster destruction mechanisms.

characterized as z-band "dropouts." We will carry out a systematic search of
these objects by combining multi-band ACS images, with deep ground-based
infrared photometry. Our goals are: {1} Discovery of {bright} z>7 galaxies, to
probe the reionization epoch of the intergalactic medium; {2} Study of the
luminosity function of galaxies at z>6. The results will provide insight into
the z>10 universe, particularly the bright end of the source distribution,

We propose to use the deep ACS images obtained by the Great Observatories

spectroscopically identified galaxies with 1.4<z<2.6 {formerly known as the
``redshift desert''} to investigate the dependence of galaxy morphology on
environment, kinematics, chemical abundances, UV emission and absorption line
strength, stellar and dynamical mass, and galaxy-scale ``superwind'' activity.
To determine these physical properties of the galaxies, we will supplement the
ACS data with rest-frame UV spectra of the entire sample, rest-frame optical
and IR images of a large portion of the field, and near-IR spectra of H-alpha
emission of a subsample. Thorough analysis of the ACS images will allow us to
test the sensitivity of existing morphological analysis tools to physical
properties of the galaxies, and to develop new metrics if the existing tools

active M dwarfs. Employing hundreds of lines in the archival spectrum as
constraints, we will construct the first self-consistent model of an M dwarf

Title:	    The Distribution and Variability of Io's SO2 Atmosphere
PI:         Lori Feaga

We propose the first comprehensive analysis of archival HI Lyman-alpha images
of Io acquired in four HST programs from 1997-2001. This dataset comprises the
best currently available data to study some of the fundamental properties of
Io's SO2 atmosphere, including spatial extent, surface pressure, origin {is
the dominant source sublimation or volcanos?}, and variability. The two viable
sources are both expected to be highly variable, the sublimation due to the
orders of magnitude change in surface vapor pressure from day- to nightside,
and the volcanos due to their inherent variability. Indeed, a preliminary look
at the archival dataset as a whole confirms the presense of obvious
variability for images of the same hemisphere taken at different times {Feaga
et al. 2003; see also Figure 4 of the proposal}. Only a single co-added
exposure of the 34 Lyman-alpha images available has been modeled previously
{Strobel & Wolven 2001}, so these data are ripe for a more thorough analysis.
Analysis tools for this type of HST data {STIS imaging spectroscopy} have been
developed previously by the PI for a project involving atomic sulfur emission
from Io {Feaga et al. 2002}. This work is timely, focused, and well within the
scope of a one year, modestly-funded archival research program.

We propose to construct high resolution maps of the dark matter distribution
in both HST-GOODS fields. The combination of depth, resolution, field size,
and availability of auxiliary data for the calculation of photometric
redshifts make these fields ideal for the construction of the first high
resolution dark matter maps in blank fields. These maps will be sensitive to
dark matter structures with masses greater than 5x10^13 h^-1 solar masses in
the redshift range 0.3<z<0.7, volumes which are well sampled by public
redshift surveys for which ancillary infrared J and K data is also available.
The infrared data, together with the GOODS optical photometry, will enable us
to associate stellar masses with redshift survey galaxies and thereby
correlate maps of the stellar and dark mass distributions on various scales.
Such correlations will provide new and important indications of how galaxies
are biased with respect to the dark matter. The high resolution maps provided
by this proposal will test techniques to be used on future, larger space-based
surveys.

Title:	    Central Surface Brightness Profiles of LMC Globular Clusters
PI:         Karl Gebhardt

The luminosity density profiles, which are obtained from surface brightness
profiles, are a crucial component for dynamical studies of any stellar system.
Thanks to HST, there has been important discoveries on the central part of
these profiles for galaxies. Globular clusters, on the other hand, have not
been explored with such level of detail. From our previous archival proposal
{AR-9542}, we find that most globular clusters do not have analytic cores.
This is in contrast to what has always been assumed, when 80% are well fitted
by King models. Weak cusps in these clusters will have important dynamical
consequences, and in particular it will be difficult to understand why these
cores are not isothermal since theoretical results predict that they should
be. Our goal here is to extend these studies to include the LMC globular
clusters. there are 53 LMC clusters in the archive, and about 75% of them have
adequate signal to obtain a central slope. This will both double the the
current sample of GC with well measured profiles, and provide excellent
coverage of parameters space, needed to compare with evolutionary models. The
LMC clusters provide an important coverage in parameter space, since they are
extremely young, and when combined with our studies of the Galactic clusters
have the most influence on the theoretical models.

Title:	    NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF OUTFLOWS IN QUASARS: THE MICROPHYSICS OF
	    BAL WINDS
PI:         Gary Ferland

Mass outflow from Broad Absorption Line {BAL} quasars is best studied with
resonant absorption lines that occur across the UV. Analysis of the lines
reveals the chemical composition, energetics, and acceleration of the ejected
material, and offers clues to the physics of the central powerhouse. HST has
allowed this phenomenon to be studied in great detail. HST spectra are
analyzed by reference to large scale plasma simulations which take into
account the detailed microphysics of the gas. However, the presence of such a
fast flow changes some of the assumptions that are the basis of current plasma
codes ? in particular the assumption that the gas is in a local steady state.
Actually, the flow introduces advection terms into all the rate equations, its
energetics can affect the thermal balance of the gas, and high velocities
affects the line and continuum transfer. This proposal requests support for
the enhancement of the spectral simulation code Cloudy to make it fully
appropriate for BAL outflows. The specific problems to be addressed are the
radiative transport of lines and continua, which become complicated for such
high-speed flows. I will also create grids of predictions that span the range
of parameters seen in BAL quasars, but which include the effects of the
outflow on both the physical state of the gas and its resulting spectrum.

Title:	    The Hydrodynamics of Collimated Flow Interactions around Dying
	    Stars
PI:         Raghvendra Sahai

The Hubble Space Telescope {HST} has imaged a substantial and growing number
of young planetary {PNe} and proto-planetary nebulae {PPNe}, with
unprecedented high angular resolution and dynamic range. These objects
represent the last phases of evolution of 1-8 solar mass stars. The data show
that young PNe have highly aspherical morphologies, characterised by
multipolar bubbles distributed roughly point-symmetrically around the central
star, and that complex morphological structures begin emerging during the PPNe
phase. We have hypothesised that the data support a model for the formation of
PNe in which high-speed collimated outflows or jets operate during the late
AGB/ early post-AGB evolutionary phase. In order to test our hypothesis,
detailed theoretical models are needed to study the hydrodynamical
interactions of post-AGB collimated fast winds with the slow AGB winds, and
understand the nature of the collimated outflows. The subsequent evolution of
these PPNe to young PNe, as the central star evolves towards higher
temperatures, also needs to be followed. The underlying jets which produce the
nebula shapes are generally not detectable in their pristine state {i.e.
before they have interacted with the ambient circumstellar medium} -
theoretical modeling is needed to derive their basic physical characteristics.
Since magnetic fields may be important in the collimation process, numerical
simulations using magneto-hydrodynamic codes are needed. However, very little
work has been done in these areas. Thus the enormous scientific potential of
HST's rich legacy of morphological and {to a lesser extent} kinematical data
on dying stars, remains virtually untapped. We propose a 2-year study to model
existing HST images of PPNe and PNe. Our work will lead to a better
understanding of astrophysical jets and their interaction with the
surroundings, as well as the physical mechanisms which shape the circumstellar
environment of dying stars.

PI:         Jill Bechtold

We propose to analyze the E230M STIS spectra of 9 quasars to derive physical
properties of the Lyman alpha forest lines in the redshift range z=0.9 to 1.6.
These quasars were originally observed to measure deuterium in metal line
systems or to study the detailed kinematics of metal absorption lines systems
to compare to ground based studies. To date, no analysis of the Lyman alpha
forest has been published for these spectra. We will combine the archive data
with data of 7 other quasars we have observed ourselves with the E230M, and
two quasars with published line lists, to derive the properties of the IGM.
The spectra will be reduced, coadded, continua fit, lines identified and Voigt
profiles fit to Lyman alpha forest lines using techniques and code developed
for our previous work. The physical characteristics of the final sample will
be compared to the expected properties derived from analysis of simulations of
the IGM. Comparison between the properties at z~1 and those at higher
redshifts accessible from the ground can test whether structure in the Lyman
alpha forest is evolving in the manner predicted by gravitational instability
theories. We will combine the HST absorption data with deep multiband imaging
and galaxy redshifts from ground-based programs underway to study the
evolution of the IGM and its relationship to the evolution of star-formation
in galaxies.

lunar samples and Vesta that show that the ultraviolet-visible wavelength
region may exhibit a relatively blue spectral shape, and in some cases may
exhibit a spectral reversal in response to space weathering. Analysis of
asteroid spectra at ultraviolet wavelengths is key to furthering our
understanding of space weathering and solar system surfaces. Here we propose
to analyze the HST and IUE spectra of asteroids that exist in the MAST
archive, to look for and better understand the effects of space weathering at

Title:	    Deep Archival Search for Trans-Neptunian Objects
PI:         Peter Tamblyn

We propose to leverage HST's demonstrated superlative capacity for detecting
faint Trans-Neptunian Objects {TNOs}. With tools we will optimize while
verifying the deep ACS survey of GO-9433 {PI Bernstein}, we will search a 5x
wider area with 30 serendipitous archive fields. Our first goal is an
independent verification of the analysis of the deep ACS survey. The GO team's
results {Bernstein et al. 2004} show a sharp departure from extrapolation of
the size distribution that has been sampled from the ground. This has
important implications for our understanding of solar system formation, the
origin of short period comets, the ages of the giant planet satellites'
surfaces, and collisional physics in general. This search is uniquely deep and
cannot be matched from the ground {in depth} or from space {in area} by other
current facilities. As it represents a substantial investment of HST time {125
orbits}, it would be expensive to repeat. The uniqueness and importance of
these data call for an independent validation of GO team's results and
completeness limit. More importantly, we propose to search 30 archival fields.
With no additional telescope time, we can conduct a new survey to a depth
comparable with the deepest ground-based surveys. Small number statistics
currently dominate our understanding of the faint end of the size
distribution, even at several magnitudes brighter than Bernstein et al.
{2004}'s completeness limit. The archive houses data appropriate to improve
meaningfully the survey space near m_R approximately 27, especially for the
scientifically important class of dynamically excited TNOs. In particular, the
area to be searched is large enough to determine if the ACS deep field was
simply "unlucky" not to harbor any faint high-inclination objects. An
extrapolation of ground-based results or an expectation that faint
high-inclination TNOs should continue to be as well represented as faint
low-inclination TNOs, suggest we should find approximately 5 TNOs on
high-inclination orbits. The HST-specific software we will develop in
revisiting the deep search is exactly what we need for this second, 5x wider
search.

We will analyze the outer parts of the surface brightness and color profiles
of dwarf star-forming galaxies at redshifts between 0<z<1 in the four bands of
the HST/ACS Ultra Deep Field {UDF}. Only in these outer regions of the
profiles, emission from the centrally concentrated star-forming activity
becomes negligible, allowing one to derive properties of the evolved stellar
low-surface-brightness halo. The comparison of the colors of the galaxy halos
with the predictions of evolutionary synthesis models will allow us to
estimate the epoch of formation of these objects. In particular, we will be
able to determine if dwarf galaxies formed before the reionization epoch {z>6}
or if this formation was delayed up to z~1-2 by the intense UV-radiation field
present at higher redshifts. The depth and high spatial resolution of the UDF
are required in order to detect the low-surface-brightness stellar population
associated with the galaxy halo and to separate and spatially resolve it from
the central, high-surface-brightness component.

PI:         Laurence Trafton

August 1999 HST/STIS observations of Io in Jupiter's shadow by Bagenal et al.
{Program 8169} revealed 1700-5000 A emission from SO2, SO, and S I that was
attributed to impact excitation/dissociation by plasma torus thermal
electrons. The conclusions of their analysis were limited by their simplified
model of Io, necessitated by the lack of laboratory data and information on
the complex geometry of Io's patchy atmosphere and volcanoes. Since then, many
Galileo observations of Io have been published which make a detailed model
atmosphere for this epoch possible with few free parameters. In addition,
laboratory experiments have better-defined both the electron-impact and NUV
absorption cross-sections of SO2. Meanwhile, we have developed the capability
to simulate the emission from the interaction of plasma particles with Io's
neutral atmosphere, overlaying a radiation code onto our 3-D Monte Carlo flow
field model of Io without making any of the unrealistic approximations of the
original analysis {i.e., uniform isothermal atmosphere; no energy lost by the
exciting electrons; and no absorption by SO2}. We propose to use these
spectral images to constrain the remaining free parameters of this simulation
to yield column abundances and atmospheric electron densities on the
Jupiter-facing side of Io. The atmospheric S/SO2 abundance ratio is a
diagnostic of SO2 dissociation in the internal volcanic magma that would
constrain the volcanic process. These eclipse observations are unique; and
they constrain models of Io's molecular atmosphere in ways no other extant
data can.

Title:	    ORIGIN OF THE GLOBULAR CLUSTER FUNDAMENTAL PLANE
PI:         Dean McLaughlin

HST has provided many revolutionary new insights on the existence, formation
and properties of star clusters in the Universe. One of the most important
findings has been that star formation in almost any environment involves the
formation of massive stellar clusters which look very much like what is
expected of halo globular clusters when they were young. This discovery has
rejuvenated ideas about globular cluster formation and star formation in
general. Nonetheless, our understanding of the globular cluster formation
process remains woefully incomplete. Although the integrated properties of
globular clusters in external galaxies have long been studied from the ground,
only with Hubble has it become possible to resolve the interiors of individual
clusters in the halo of M31 and more distant galaxies. This has shown that
globular clusters always have the same typical half-light radius of about 3
pc. This generalizes earlier findings for Milky Way clusters to a wide range
of galactic environments and metallicities. Even more, with Hubble it is
becoming increasingly clear that the same is true for young massive clusters.
Phrased differently, the properties of clusters of all types define a
remarkably uniform fundamental plane. While the ubiquity of this plane becomes
clearer with every new Hubble observation, it remains a mystery what processes
during cluster formation regulate its existence. It is also not understood why
clusters {size independent of mass} and galaxies {size increases with mass}
follow such different scaling relations. We will target these questions with a
theoretical study of cluster formation. Using a semi-analytical approach we
will study which processes and parameters are the driving force behind the
observed relations. Theoretical work is badly needed to provide a coherent
framework for the interpretation of the many important cluster results that
Hubble has provided. Our study is therefore ideally suited for the Hubble
Theory Program.

PI:         Caryl Gronwall

The discovery of large numbers of Lyman-break galaxies has revolutionized our
ability to study the distant universe. Today, narrow-band surveys have finally
caught up and are detecting Ly-alpha emission-line galaxies {ELGs} from z=2.4
to z=6.5. These are important objects: not only do they sample a part of the
galaxy luminosity function that is inaccessible to the Lyman-break technique,
but they also tend to be younger and less chemically evolved. As a result,
these ELGs present us with a unique opportunity to study galaxies in the
process of formation. We have performed several ground-based narrow-band
surveys for ELGs at z~3.1, including one centered on the Chandra Deep Field
South. Spectroscopy has confirmed that our objects have broad {~450 km/s},
asymmetric line profiles, consistent with that of a starburst galaxy. We
propose to use archival HST ACS WFC observations of the Chandra Deep Field
South from the GOODS treasury program to study the morphology of Ly-alpha ELGs
at z=3.11. Our recent ground-based survey of this field contains about 10
Ly-alpha ELGs within the GOODS ACS WFC pointings. The F775W and F850LP images
will detect the objects' rest-frame UV continuum, and allow us to measure
their structure on sub-kpc scales. With these data we can probe the physical
nature of these distant objects and derive important new insights on the
nature of galaxy formation. In addition, we will directly compare the
properties of our ELGs to similar objects found at higher redshift {4 < z <
7}, and to the Lyman-break galaxies contained in the field. This sample is an
important lower redshift counterpart to recent discoveries of Ly-alpha ELGs at
higher redshift {z = 4 - 7}. In addition, we will be able to directly compare
the properties of the emission-line sources to Lyman-break galaxies at the
same redshift in the same field discovered by the GOODS team.

This proposal has two main scientific goals: to determine the dark matter
distribution of massive galaxy clusters, and to observe the high redshift
universe using these clusters as powerful cosmic telescopes. Deep, g, r, i, z
imaging of a sample of low-z {0.2-0.4} clusters will yield a large sample of
lensed background galaxies with reliable photometric redshifts. By combining
strong and weak lensing constraints with the photometric redshift information
it will be possible to precisely measure the cluster dark matter distribution
with an unprecedented combination of high spatial resolution and area
coverage, avoiding many of the uncertainties which plague ground-based studies
and yielding definitive answers about the structure of massive dark matter
haloes. In addition, the cosmological parameters can be constrained in a
largely model independent way using the multiply lensed objects due to the
dependence of the Einsteinng radius on the distance to the source. We can also
expect to detect several highly magnified dropout galaxies behind the clusters
in the redshift ranges 4-5 5-6 and 7-8, corresponding to a drop in the flux in
the g, r, and i bands relative to longer wavelength. We will obtain the best
information to date on the giant arcs already known in these clusters, making
possible detailed, pixel-by-pixel studies of their star formation rate, dust
distribution and structural components, including spiral arms, out to a
redshift of around z~2.5 in several passbands.

central fields during Cycle 11. The resulting wide-field mosaic of RX J0152-13
will enable direct study of the population of galaxies falling into this
cluster and will provide a much needed comparison to our on-going wide-field
study of the more massive, 10.5keV cluster MS1054-03 at the same redshift.
Imaging RX J0152-13 to twice its viral radius enables us to: {1} trace the
transformation of infalling field spirals into cluster early-types using,
e.g., the morphology-density relation to large radii and very low local
densities; {2} determine the importance of galaxy-galaxy interactions, i.e.,
whether the frequency of such encounters in the infall region is as
unexpectedly high as found in MS1054-03; and {3} study in detail the
star-formation histories of the most recently accreted members via accurate
colors and morphologies. A comparison of RX J0152-13 with MS1054-03 will also
allow us to directly probe the dependence of galaxy evolution on cluster mass.
Only by pairing the wide-field ACS mosaic of RX J0152-13 with multi-object
spectroscopy from the Magellan, Keck, and VLT telescopes can we test
predictions from galaxy formation models, understand how field spirals evolve
into early-type cluster members, and better constrain the formation of

This programme uses ACS observations of the high-redshift radio galaxy

overdensities in both line-emitting {both Lyman-alpha and H-alpha} and

and field-coverage of HST/ACS we can obtain the colors and morphologies for a
substantial fraction of these protocluster galaxies. These morphologies and
colors will be compared to studies of field galaxies at similar redshifts

the presumed central dominant galaxy of this cluster, will allow us to study

Title:	    Massive Black Holes in Early Type Galaxies
PI:         Holland Ford

This program is a continuation of the Cycles 11 and 12 ACS/GTO programs 9293
and 9986. Recently, a nearly perfect relation has been recognized between the
masses of the black holes {for 3x10^6 Msun < M_BH < 3x10^9 Msun} at the
centers of galaxies and the velocity dispersions of their bulges. However,
uncertainties over the exact slope of the correlation still remain, and it is
not known if such a relation extends to black holes of lower and higher
masses. The discovery of small {r ~ a few hundred pc}, well defined, dust and
gas disks in the nuclei of some active elliptical galaxies opened a new avenue
for measuring central mass distributions. When ionized gas is present, a small
number of high spatial resolution {e.g. STIS} spectra are sufficient to
characterize the disk dynamics and the galaxy's central mass {e.g., M87, M81,
NGC 4374}. We propose to use STIS spectroscopy to measure black hole masses,
using gas dynamics, in the centers of several brightest cluster galaxies
{BCGs}, 2 nearby galaxies with low velocity dispersions, and a number of
early-type galaxies known to harbor small nuclear dust disks. The proposed
targets encompass a wide range of black hole masses, allowing us to fully
examine the M_BH - sigma relationship. In Cycle 11, we obtained H-alpha and
continuum images of most of the targets to fully characterize their gaseous
and dust morphologies as well as their core stellar surface profile. In Cycle
12, we completed the imaging {NGC 7720} and performed STIS spectroscopy of two
of the best candidates, NGC 404 and NGC 2768. In this Cycle 13 program, we
continue the STIS spectroscopy for two other galaxies, NGC 6166 and NGC 7720.

and B, tau Ceti, and epsilon Eridani. The observations of each star will be
taken at two or more epochs. The observations will be broken into a sequence

"telescope breathing" during the orbit. As a further precaution, the

order to minimize thermal changes in the OTA during the first orbit of
observations. After matching phases, the PSFs from one star will be subtracted

We will use the coronagraphic and imaging modes of the High Resolution camera
to study of the role of circumstellar disks in planetary system formation over
timescales of ~1-1000 Myr. Our targets comprise pre Main-Sequence {MS} and MS
stars, selected by infrared excess, and targets selected from SIRTF surveys.
Some targets, like Beta Pictoris have debris disks that have been detected at
optical or near-IR wavelengths, while others have disks inferred from mid-IR
or ISO observations. We will obtain multicolor images of each target's
circumstellar environment for the purpose of {1} detecting and characterizing
disk morphologies over all scales {including warps and regions of enhanced or
depleted density}, and {2} seeking evidence of embedded planets. Direct and
occulted images will be recorded for studying the disks within 2 arcseconds of
these targets; the coronagraph will be used to image the outer regions of the
disks. Together with existing infrared observations, we will provide
constraints on the sizes, distribution, and composition of dust grains.
Unconfirmed disks will first be imaged in F606W, and if they exist we may
later observe them in F435W and F814W.

Title:	    Jovian Satellites
PI:         Holland Ford

The icy Galilean satellites form an integral but poorly understood component
of Jupiter's magnetospheric system. While the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft
encounters yielded evidence for the existence of a source of oxygen ions
beyond Io's orbit, conclusive evidence that Europa and Ganymede possess thin
oxygen atmospheres was only recently provided by HST/GHRS detections of faint
far-UV airglow emissions of OI. Moreover, the OI emission on Ganymede is
localized to the region of the satellite's poles, consistent with an auroral
excitation source that would be expected from the internal magnetic field of
Ganymede. More recently, spectrally resolved images of Ganymede obtained with
STIS have confirmed this result and demonstrated the variation in location and
brightness of the OI emissions with the position of Ganymede relative to
Jupiter's plasmasheet. The energy and source of the exciting electrons remain
unknown and there is little or no relevant in situ Galileo data that bear
directly on this question and thus the determination of the molecular
abundance remains highly uncertain. However, the energy can be constrained by
the observation of the forbidden OI red line at 6300 Ang, but this requires
observation when the satellite is in Jupiter's shadow, to avoid the emissions
being swamped by the strong solar reflected light. Europa similarly shows the
UV OI emissions, and recent HST/STIS observations show a complex
time-dependent variation in the spatial distribution of these emissions.
Europa does not have an intrinsic magnetic field, but rather the Jovian field
at Europa is modified by a magnetic field induced by Europa's rotation. We
will investigate Kivelson's suggested European conducting ocean by timing
observations to coincide with different orientations of the induced magnetic
field.

Title:	    Starburst Galaxies and Their Population of Super Star Clusters
PI:         Holland Ford

Starbursts are ideally suited to study the evolution of high mass stars, the
physics of star formation, and the chemical enrichment of the intergalactic
medium {IGM}. Starbursts efficiently form Super Star Clusters {SSC} which may
be young protoglobular clusters. High resolution imaging will address two
important outstanding issues: 1} how long starbursts last and 2} whether SSCs
are indeed young globular clusters. The duration of starbursts is important
because: {1} it determines how efficiently a starburst can heat and enrich the
IGM; {2} the duration combined with estimates of the fraction of galaxies
which host starbursts yields the total number of starbursts a galaxy can
suffer. Finally, since local starbursts are analogs to high-z galaxies, the
results have implications on the initial formation timescale of galaxies.
Starburst duration will be determined from HRC imaging of two face-on
starburst galaxies rich in SSCs. The UV to optical colors of the SSCs, which
represent single burst chronometers, will yield their reddening and ages. The
range of ages gives the starburst duration. The nature of SSCs will be
investigated by imaging four of the nearest starbursts in three bands. By
comparing the sizes of their SSCs at different wavelengths we will address the
issue of whether SSCs suffer from early mass segregation. Without some mass
segregation the velocity dispersions of SSCs suggest that they are deficient
in low mass stars, and hence may not represent true proto-globular clusters.

Title:	    Comet Hale-Bopp at large heliocentric distance
PI:         Holland Ford

The objective is to determine the size, shape, and possible presence of a
small, possibly bound, companion. The latter has been reported by Marchis et
al. using the ADONIS adaptive optics system on the ESO 3.6 meter telescope.
They claim separations of the two components of 0.23'' {November 1997} and
0.36'' {January 1998} when the comet was 3.3 and 4.1 AU from the Sun. Such a
companion is not evident in any STIS images recorded by Weaver et al., but
these were single snapshots in time and the companion may have been occulted.
The discovery of a bound companion, and the subsequent determination of its
orbital period, would provide the first determination of a cometary mass and
the density of a cometary nucleus. At large heliocentric distances there will
still be residual dust coma so the highest possible spatial resolution {HRC
near 300 nm} is needed to model the coma and photometrically isolate the
nucleus. The near infrared is best suited for evaluation of the spatial
distribution of the dust coma. With proper choice of filter it is also
possible to search for a gas coma {CN at 388 nm}. Ideally the comet should be
imaged over a complete 11.3 hour rotation period, but a half period would be
sufficient to obtain an idea of the shape of the reflecting body. Hale-Bopp is
visible throughout 2002. During the period 1 March 2002 to 28 February 2003
the heliocentric distance increases from 15.2 to 17.3 AU. The expected nucleus
magnitude {visible} is 16.5-17.0

Title:	    NICMOS Imaging of a z=2.2 Protocluster: The Color-Magnitude
	    Relation at High-Redshift
PI:         Holland Ford

To establish the epoch when galaxy environment manifests itself as a
large-scale evolutionary process, we propose to extend the study of galaxy
colors and morphologies to a protocluster at z=2.16. Here the universe is only
3 Gyrs old and significant differences are expected between scenarios favoring
a morphology-radius relation over a morphology-density relation. In addition,
because the fractional age differences among cluster galaxies are larger,
study of the color-magnitude relation provides considerable leverage for
determining the epoch of early-type galaxy formation. To facilitate direct
comparison to studies at lower redshift, one must probe the same rest-frame
wavelengths with high photometric accuracy and at similar physical scales. Its
near-infrared photometric stability {low, constant background} and ability to
image large areas of sky at high angular-resolution {compared to adaptive
optics} makes HST/NICMOS ideal for this program. Four pointings of NICMOS
camera 3 will result in rest-frame optical, high resolution images of 13
confirmed protocluster members, and an additional 25 candidate protocluster
members including 26 EROs. These galaxies were selected with a variety of
techniques and span a range of projected radii within the protocluster. The
proposed observations constitute a unique opportunity to extend the study of
galaxies in overdense regions to an early time in cosmic history.

Type Ia supernovae {SNe Ia} provide the only direct evidence for an
accelerating universe, an extraordinary result that needs the most rigorous
test. The case for cosmic acceleration rests on the observation that SNe Ia at
z = 0.5 are about 0.25 mag fainter than they would be in a universe without
acceleration. A powerful and straightforward way to assess the reliability of
the SN Ia measurement and the conceptual framework of its interpretation is to
look for cosmic deceleration at z > 1. This would be a clear signature of a
mixed dark-matter and dark-energy universe. Systematic errors in the SNe Ia
result attributed to grey dust or cosmic evolution of the SN Ia peak
luminosity would not show this change of sign. We have obtained a toehold on
this putative ``epoch of deceleration'' with SN 1997ff at z = 1.7, and 3 more
at z > 1 from our Cycle 11 program, all found and followed by HST. However,
this is too important a test to rest on just a few objects, anyone of which
could be subject to a lensed line-of-sight or misidentification. Here we
propose to extend our measurement with observations of twelve SNe Ia in the
range 1.0 < z < 1.5 or 6 such SNe Ia and 1 ultradistant SN Ia at z = 2, that
will be discovered as a byproduct from proposed Treasury and DD programs.
These objects will provide a much firmer foundation for a conclusion that
touches on important questions of fundamental physics.

Title:	    The D/H Ratio in C/2002 T7 {LINEAR}
PI:         Harold Weaver

Measuring the D/H ratio in comets is one of the most important scientific
objectives in planetary science. A comparison of the D/H ratio in comets to
the value measured in the Earth's oceans can be used to assess whether
cometary impacts contributed significantly to the delivery of water and other
volatiles to the Earth. A comparison of the cometary ratio with the value in
other solar system reservoirs {e.g., in the solar wind and the atmospheres of
the Giant Planets}, and to values observed in the interstellar medium, can be
used to determine how primitive cometary matter is. Our recent detection of
the deuterium Lyman-alpha line in C/2001 Q4 {NEAT} demonstrates that HST has a
new and potentially important role to play in this exciting area of research.
Fortuitously, another moderately bright comet, C/2002 T7 {LINEAR}, is
well-placed for HST observations in early June, and we request 8 orbits of HST
time to measure deuterium in this comet. If our observations are successful,
the number of comets for which D/H has been measured will be nearly doubled.

PI:         Rita Sambruna

There is evidence that FRI jets have a fast "spine", consisting of
relativistically moving plasma, and a slow "wall", decelerated by entrainement
of ambient gas. This opens the interesting possibility that inverse Compton
scattering of the CMB photons {IC/CMB} off the relativistic electrons could
contribute to the high-energy emission from the fast spine. This strongly
beamed radiation is visibile only in closely aligned FRI jets, i.e.,
acccording to unification schemes, in BL Lac objects. Thus, we propose to
observe 2 radio-selected BL Lacs with prominent radio jets to search for
IC/CMB X-ray emission and confirm unification models. This study will impact

glaring weakness in our understanding of energetics around young stars. An
HETG observation of the CTTS TW Hya suggested that the physical properties of
the hot gas around accreting stars may be different from solar-like coronae.
This difference hints that accretion may produce most of the X-rays from
CTTSs. However, this tentative conclusion is based on observations of only one
CTTS, that may not be representative of its class. We seek to verify this
conclusion, and to obtain a better understanding of the temperature, electron

We propose to measure the proper motions in the X-ray source associtasted with
the HH 154 jet.This is the only known protostellar jet, where the X-ray
enmission can be studied in detail. Our numericval simulations show that the
X-ray source is produced in a fast-moving post-shock region {500 km/s}, and
earlier HST observations {1996, 1998} together with ground based spectra
identifythe potential region from which the X-rays should emanate. Detection
{or lack of} the X-rays with Chandra, and the associated optical region with
HST will either strongly confirm {or falsify} our model. This will constitute
the basis for a general theory for the formation of X-rays in protostellar
jets. Understanding and modellling the emission mechanism of X-rays is key to
estimate the lifetime and evolution of the X-ray jets and understand their
influence on the star {and planetary-} formation process in general.
Associating the right optical material {HST} with the X-ray source {Chandra}

Title:	    Galactic Bulge Chandra-HST Survey
PI:         Jonathan Grindlay

We propose a deep survey for low-luminosity accretion-powered sources {CVs,
qLMXBs and wind-fed pulsars} that likely constitute the underlying populations
in the cusp of sources around SgrA*. A 100 ksec pointing at l, b = 0.10, -1.43
degr. allows the survey closest to the galactic center that can still be
reached in the optical. With 12 orbits of HST, we can complement the two outer
fields {Baade's Window and Stanek's Window} obtained with Chandra-HST to
complete the most sensitive X-ray/optical survey of the Galactic Bulge.

Title:	    Probing the Link between Galactic Bars & Starburst/AGN Activity in

PI:         Leigh Jenkins

Multi-wavelength data have shown that a substantial fraction of barred spiral
galaxies exhibit enhanced star formation activity in their central regions.
This phenomena is however poorly studied at X-ray energies. We propose joint
Chandra/HST observations of two barred starburst galaxies NGC1672 and NGC7771.
We request Chandra observations to spatially resolve the X-ray emission into
point sources and diffuse emission, enabling us to trace the star formation on
small spatial scales and search for obscured starburst/AGN activity. We also
request a complimentary optical imaging program with HST/ACS, permitting us to
identify the optical counterparts to X-ray point sources and map the optical
emission from star formation in their local environments on similar scales to
Chandra.

Title:	    Planet-Induced Activity enhancements in the HD 179949 Systems
PI:         Steven Saar

Many exoplanets are gas giants extremely close {<0.1 AU} to their parent
stars, suggesting the posssiblitiy of exotic interactions. Recently, weakly
enhanced Ca II HK emission was found in the HD 179949 system, phased to the
orbital {~3 d} and not to the stellar rotation period {~8 d}. Theory suggests
this enhancement is due to a magnetic interaction {MI} between the star and
planet. Since the resulting heating should be largest in X-rays, we propose to
study the system with Chandra to further characterize the MI. We will use HST
to study the MI effect on the planet's ablating atmosphere by observing
Doppler shifted H~I around quadrature. These datasets will enable us to test
interaction theories, and estimate exoplanetary magnetic fields, mass loss and
stellar wind properties.

Title:	    Saturn's Inner Satellites at True Opposition
PI:         Anne Verbiscer

We request one HST orbit to observe Janus, Epimetheus, Mimas, and Enceladus
with WFPC2 exactly at opposition, when the Earth transits the center of the
solar disk seen from Saturn on UT 13/14 January 2005. Data obtained at this
unique viewing geometry are essential to determining physical properties of
the moon's surface, related to its emplacement and evolution, and critical for
the interpretation of photometric data obtained by Cassini at higher phase
angles. This single observation will be the capstone of 9 years of legacy HST
WFPC2 observations of the saturnian system {Cycles 6-12, R. French, PI} from
which we have constructed precise, multiwavelength phase curves which
demonstrate how the reflectance of these satellites varies with solar phase
angle from 0.07 to 6.4 degrees. Each satellite exhibits a dramatic increase in
brightness, or "opposition effect", as phase angles decrease below 1 degree.
Since 1998 {Cycle 7} the minimum observable phase angle at opposition has
decreased each year to 0.07 degrees in Cycle 12; however, the absolute minimum
observable phase angle, about 0.02 degrees {limited by the angular size of the
Sun viewed from Saturn}, has not been accessible until Cycle 13. Using the
same set of broadband filters for continuity with our previous programs, we
will place observations made during the Earth transit on the existing UVBRI
phase curves and establish the amplitude of each satellite's opposition surge.
From these observations we will determine surface properties such as porosity,
grain size distribution and particle opacity using radiative transfer models.
While the Cassini spacecraft will obtain images at larger phase angles, it
will miss entirely the narrow brightness surge near opposition due to orbital
constraints. Because these inner satellites will be either lost in or
contaminated by the glare of the fully open rings, they are not accessible to
ground-based telescopes. The 2005 opposition prese nts the only opportunity
for HST to observe the saturnian system during this rare planetary alignment.
The next transit of Earth across the solar disk seen from Saturn occurs in
2020; the next central transit occurs in 2049.

sequences, to be done once during the year, are similar to those from the
Cycle 12 program 10075. The images will provide a backup database in the event
of complete failure of the visflat lamp as well as allow monitoring of the
gain ratios. The sweep is a complete set of internal flats, cycling through
both shutter blades and both gains. The linearity test consists of a series of
intflats in F555W, in each gain and each shutter. As in Cycle 12, we plan to
continue to take extra visflat, intflat, and earthflat exposures to test the
repeatability of filter wheel motions.

Hot pixel annealing will continue to be performed once every 4 weeks. The CCD
TECs will be turned off and heaters will be activated to bring the detector
temperatures to about +20C. This state will be held for approximately 12
hours, after which the heaters are turned off, the TECs turned on, and the
CCDs returned to normal operating condition. To assess the effectiveness of
the annealing, a bias and four dark images will be taken before and after the
annealing procedure for both WFC and HRC. The HRC darks are taken in parallel
with the WFC darks. The charge transfer efficiency {CTE} of the ACS CCD
detectors declines as damage due to on-orbit radiation exposure accumulates.
This degradation has been closely monitored at regular intervals, because it
is likely to determine the useful lifetime of the CCDs. We will now combine
the annealling activity with the charge transfer efficiency monitoring and
also merge into the routine dark image collection. To this end, the CTE
monitoring exposures have been moved into this proposal . All the data for

check, high voltage ramp-up to an intermediate voltage, and high voltage
ramp-up to the full operating voltage. During each of the two high voltage
ramp-ups, diagnostics are performed during a dark ACCUM. The turn-on is

This program consists of three parts. In the first part we will observe a
subset of the ACS white dwarfs with HRC and ACS to verify repeatability to
~0.2%, because the filter shifts are based on photometric differences between
stars of ~1%. These observations are also required to establish relative
magnitudes of the primary WD standards at the 0.1% level. Targets should be
GD153 and G191B2B, which seems to have the largest V mag error of ~0.008
mag. One orbit on the most important filters, including the grism and the
prisms, should be expended with each camera for both stars for a total of 4
orbits. In the second part will observe with HRC and WFC a solar analog star,
P330E, to estimate any shifts in the short and the long wavelength cutoffs of
selected filters. Complete filter bandpasses can be derived directly from the
ratio of grism observations with and without the filter in place. The grism is
on filter wheel 1, while four filters of interest F330W, F344N, F660N, and
F814W are on wheel 2. Each grism observation requires 3 settings: filter
alone, filter+grism, and grism alone. In the third part we obtain high S/N
photometric and spectroscopic observations of three red stars, VB-8 {M7},
2M0038+18 {L3.5} and 2M0559-14 {T5} with HRC and WFC to verify the photometry
at the new standard position and to obtain accurate calibration {1% or better}
of the grism spectra.

has been observed during SMOV to derive low frequency corrections to the
ground flats and to create a master catalogue of positions and magnitudes from
dithered observations of the cluster. In Cycles 11-12, this field was observed
again using single pointings at various roll angles. The positions and
magnitudes of objects are used to monitor local and large scale variations in
the plate scale and the sensitivity of the detectors. The Cycle 13 program

Title:	    NICMOS Cycle 13 Grism Re-Calibration
PI:         Ralph Bohlin

The NICMOS grism is an underutilized resource for science, in particular for
precision IR spectrophotometry. This cycle 13 program is a minimal follow up
and closeout for the 10 orbit cycle 12 program 9998 and for 14 orbits in
10014. If GO grism usage remains light in cycle 14, this two orbit sensitivity
monitoring program could also suffice as a cycle 13 closeout calibration for
this mode. The goals of the Cycle 12-13 grism calibration campaign are: 1.
Provide a robust characterization of the absolute flux calibration for the two
shorter wavelength NICMOS grisms, including quantitative measurement of
repeatability and estimates of the uncertainty. 2. Verification to better than
1-percent accuracy of the relative fluxes of the three primary WD standard
stars and of the relative fluxes of the three secondary solar analog standard
stars to 1.9 microns. The same verification has already been done with STIS
{Bohlin, Dickenson, & Calzetti 2001} below 1micron. 3. Characterization of the
differences between the WD and the solar analog flux scales in the IR; and
establishment of the best basis for all absolute IR flux calibrations,
including the other NICMOS filters, SNAP, JWST, and WFPC3. 4. Establishment of
one fainter IR standard stars to prove the ability of the NICMOS grism to do
precision spectrophotometry at 3-5 magnitudes fainter than the other six
standard stars. The fainter standard will provide the basis for relative
fluxes on SNAP and may be faint enough for the higher dispersion spectral
modes of NIRSpec and MIRI on JWST. SNAP requires standards with ~1-percent
relative flux from 0.35-1.7microns to accurately determine the parameters of
the equation of state for the dark energy that causes the accelerating
expansion of the universe. 5. In summary, these data will establish for the
first time an absolute flux basis in the IR that will be of comparable
fidelity to the optical flux standards. 6. This cycle 13 proposal will
quantify the repeatability of grism observations with a star that has already
been observed in cycle 12. CYCLE 12 RESULTS AND CYCLE 13 FOLLOW UP: All cycle
12 data was successfully acquired. One problem is that the repeatability as
measured by the comparison of the cycle 11 to the cycle 12 observations of
P330E is only +/- 2%, as shown in Fig. 1 {attached to the Phase 1
distribution}. We have extracted and corrected the cycle 12 data for
intra-pixel and pixel gap sensitivity variations at each of the 15 dither
positions. The rms of these sets of 15 dithered spectra, ie the scatter about
the mean of an individual spectrum, is typically 1-2-percent, making the error
in the mean <0.5-percent for all the pixels in the central 90-percent of the
wavelength coverage.The goal and expectation is for repeatability to better
than 1%. The somewhat poorer results may be attributed to flat field
differences between the Thompson dither strategy and that used in 9998; or
perhaps, there is some synoptic change in the system throughput. In order to
distinguish these possibilities and hopefully recover a repeatability of 1%,
an observation of one of the cycle 12 standards must be repeated early in
cycle 13, using the same dither strategy as 9998. To minimize the measured
amount of any synoptic sensitivity change, the observations should be made
before the end of 2004. The bulk of the cycle 12 observations were made in the

target was observed early in 2004 and can be observed again this fall. The
bright Sloan standard BD+17d4708 is the ideal selection, having been
previously observed on 04Jan10. P330E would be a good choice, except that it
was previously observed too recently on 04Jun19 to measure any sensitivity
change back to 04 Jan; and the scheduling would be rushed to get it before

Title:	    Spectrophotometry of Solar Analog Stars and Nicmos Grism
	    Calibration
PI:         Ralph Bohlin

NICMOS IR Standards {4 orbits} In cycle 12, 24 orbits were used to measure the
NICMOS grism mode sensitivities and to establish a set of IR flux standards
with a goal of 1% accuracy. However, the G096 setting shows up to 5%
peak-to-peak range among the sensitivities derived from the three primary WD
standards, as shown in Figure 1 {for the Phase 1 proposal}. The possible
causes of this large scatter include changes in the flat field, a systematic
change of sensitivity with time, and a fundamental limitation of the
repeatability for stars at the WD flux levels. The same residuals for STIS in
the 0.8-1.0 micron overlap range are <1%, so that the problem is not with the
fluxes for the three primary standard stars. Either there is a systematic
trend in the Nicmos grism data that can be removed with more monitoring; or
alternatively, repeating the cycle 12 observations should reduce the error in
the mean sensitivity by sqrt{2}, if the deviations among the stars are random
instrumental fluctuations. The NICMOS cycle 13 calibration program includes 2
orbits to repeat the observations of the bright standard BD+17d4708, which has
a very high S/N, so that any change in its response should reflect an
instrumental sensitivity difference between cycle 12 and 13. The four Nicmos
orbits in this program include one each for GD71 and GD153 in G096 and G141,
while two orbits are required for the repeat of G191B2B, where the G206 mode
is also included.

Title:	    Long Term Monitoring of FGS1r in Position Mode
PI:         Edmund Nelan

It is known from our experience with FGS3, and later with FGS1r, that an FGS
on orbit experiences long term evolution, presumably due to disorption of
water from the instrument's graphite epoxy composits. This manifests principly
as a change in the plate scale and secondarily as a change in the geometric
distortions. These effects are well modeled by adjustments to the rhoA and kA
parameters which are used to transform the star selector servo angles into FGS
{x, y} detector space coordinates. By observing the relative positions of
selected stars in a standard cluster at a fixed telescope pointing and
orientation, the evolution of rhoA and kA can be monitored and calibrated to
preserve the astrometric performance of FGS1r.

PI:         Paul Kalas

We report the unexpected detection of the Fomalhaut debris disk in scattered
light during one orbit of observation for our Cycle 12 program GO9862. This is
a major discovery because Fomalhaut is now the closest {7.7 pc} and oldest
{~200 Myr} debris disk detected in reflected light. We would like to request
Director's Discretionary Time to further study the Fomalhaut disk. The goals
are to image the disk around its entire perimeter, increase the
signal-to-noise of the detection, and to obtain data at a second wavelength.
We will perform a high-resolution study of radial and azimuthal disk
asymmetries that are thought to arise from perturbations by planet-mass
companions, and we will constrain the physical properties of grain material by
obtaining the color of the disk. Because our original Cycle 12 program was
designed to study point sources in the field, and the ACS/HRC coronagraph is a
limited lifetime resource, it is necessary to acquire these additional data
via Director's Discretionary Time during Cycle 13. The observational challenge
of high contrast cannot be met by other observatories, and these data will
complement new Spitzer results on the Fomalhaut disk at mid and far-infared
wavelengths.

of GCs, as part of a very wide area CCD survey of M31. These clusters span a
range in projected galactocentric distance of 20 - 80 kpc, more than double
the radii of the previous most remote known GC. Here we apply for deep ACS

line-of-sight distances and structural parameters. These will be used to: a}
Investigate the merger history of M31, through an examination of variations in
the RGB and HB morphologies, particularly to obtain metallicities and check
for the presence of any second parameter effect in the HB. d} Determine, in

PI:         Meghan Gray

Galaxies in dense environments are subject to numerous physical processes that
leave a lasting impact, yet studies of galaxy evolution to date have been
limited to the most luminous galaxies -- those least sensitive to
environmental influence. We propose to explore the environmental drivers of
DWARF galaxy evolution: with a mosaic of 9x9 ACS pointings in F606W we will
determine morphologies for ~1200 galaxies down to M_V=-14 in the A901/902
supercluster, spanning 3x3 Mpc at z=0.16. The deep ACS data will allow us to
probe their surface brightness profiles, shapes, sizes, asymmetry and fine
structure such as tidal features. With the addition of extensive existing
multi-wavelength data, we will probe the dependence of these important
parameters on dark matter content {from weak lensing maps}, the hot
intercluster medium {from deep XMM-Newton imaging}, and local galaxy density
{from hyper-accurate COMBO-17 photometric redshifts with \delta z=0.02 to
m_R=24}, thus disentangling the various environmental processes shaping dwarf
galaxy evolution. Furthermore, the 8000+ background galaxies at 0.2<z<1.0 will
be of enormous scientific benefit for additional studies of weak lensing, AGN
host galaxies, the morphology-density relation, and the merger rate as a
function of redshift.

As the closest star forming dwarf galaxy, the SMC is the preferred location
for detailed studies of this extremely common class of objects. We therefore
propose to use the capabilities of ACS, which provide an improvement by an
order of magnitude over what is possible with ground-based optical imaging
surveys that are limited by confusion anddepth, to measure key stellar
population parameters in the SMC from VI color-magnitude diagrams. Our program
focuses on regions where crowding makes HST essential and includes 7 star
clusters and 7 field star locations. We will measure accurate ages of the
clusters, test stellar evolution models, gain fiducial stellar sequences to
use in fitting the field stars, check the form of the IMF, and substantially
extend the study of RR Lyrae variables in the key NGC121 SMC globular cluster.
The field pointings will allow us to reconstruct the star formation history,
look for enhanced star formation that is expected when the SMC interacts with
the LMC and/or Milky Way, and compare its main sequence luminosity {and mass}
functions with those of the Milky Way, LMC, and UMi dwarf spheroidal. This
proposal is part of a coordinated HST and ground-based study of the stellar

Intergalactic stellar populations and tidal debris are now recognized as
important components of galaxy clusters. This project examines the
interrelated processes of galaxy destruction, recycling of tidal debris, and
creation of dwarf galaxies and intergalactic star clusters, all of which are
part of the grand scheme of cluster formation. We propose deep multicolor
imaging of two examples of newly created tidal debris, the spectacular plumes
in the Centaurus and Coma clusters. The Centaurus observations will extend our
earlier work, which demonstrated the existence of tidal debris dwarf galaxies
and star cluster in the body of the Centaurus plume. Deep ACS/WFC observations
can determine rough ages and cluster membership, better characterizing the new
debris. The Coma observations will reproduce this work for a second plume
feature, in the quintessential rich cluster of galaxies. Parallel WFPC2
observations will investigate the central intracluster spaces at the bottom of
the each cluster's potential, where older debris is thickest.

PI:         Mark Showalter

We will use the High Resolution Channel {HRC} of ACS to study the inner rings,
arcs and moons of Neptune with a sensitivity that exceeds that achieved by
Voyager 2 during its 1989 flyby. Our study will reveal any moons down to V
magnitude 25.5, to address a peculiar truncation in the size distribution of
inner moons and to look for the "shepherds" and source bodies for Neptune's
dusty rings. {For comparison, Neptune's smallest known moon is Naiad, at
magnitude 23.9}. Recent ground-based studies show that the mysterious arcs in
the Adams Ring continue to shift and change, and may be fading away entirely.
We will obtain the visual-band data uniquely necessary to determine whether
the arcs are fading. Long-term monitoring of the arcs at high resolution and
sensitivity will reveal their gradual changes more clearly and enable us to
assess the role of Galatea, whose resonances are widely believed to confine
the arcs.

PI:         Lincoln Greenhill

The extragalactic distance scale {EDS} is defined by a comparison of Cepheid
Period-Luminosity {PL} relations for nearby galaxies and the LMC, whose
uncertain distance is thereby the SOLE anchor. Studies of masers orbiting the
central black hole in NGC4258 have provided the most accurate extragalactic
distance ever {7.2+/-0.5 Mpc}, and new radio data and analysis techniques will
reduce the uncertainty to < 3.5% {0.07 mag} by 2005. Since this distance is
well determined and based on geometric arguments, NGC4258 can provide a much
needed new anchor for the EDS. Ultimately, the combination of an independent
measurement of H0 and measurements of CMB fluctuations {e.g., WMAP} can be
used to directly constrain cosmological parameters including the equation of
state of dark energy. In our Cycle 12 proposal, we defined a program spanning
two cycles. The Cycle 12 portion was accepted. We have acquired WFC images and
are constructing well sampled PL relations in 3 colors {BVI}. The purpose of
the Cycle 13 observations is to address systematic sources of error and is
crucial for the success of the entire program. To disentangle the effects of
reddening and metallicity, and to characterize the effects of blending, we
require 50 orbits to obtain H-band photometry {NICMOS/NIC2} and high
resolution images {ACS/HRC}.

PI:         Rupali Chandar

Based on cycle 10 STIS UV spectroscopy, we have recently discovered a star
cluster, NGC 3125-1, which has the strongest known He II 1640 emission {of
stellar origin} in the local universe. The number of implied WR stars is more
than an order of magnitude higher than for any other well-studied giant HII
region. Because strong He II 1640 emission has been discovered in the
composite spectra of redshift 3 Lyman Break Galaxies, NGC 3125-1 potentially
provides a unique opportunity to study a nearby object with direct
implications for the stellar populations observed in the early universe. In
order to understand the origin of this anomalously strong WR feature, we
propose to obtain the first high resolution imaging of NGC 3125-1, at
wavelengths from the far ultraviolet through the near infrared. This will
allow us to simultaneously place it in the context of more familiar objects,
such as R136 in 30 Doradus, while also unravelling the physics responsible for
the observed UV spectral signature.

PI:         Rupali Chandar

Establishing the presence or absence of intermediate-mass black holes {IMBH}
in globular clusters is crucial for understanding the evolution of dense
stellar systems. We propose a systematic search for IMBHs by conducting an
imaging/proper motion study of the centers of five of the closest, most
centrally concentrated Galactic globular clusters. ACS/HRC observations allow
for accurate proper motion measurements for stars all the way into the center
of each cluster. Our approach consists of exploiting the blue/near-ultraviolet
wavelength range in each of cycles 13 and 14, in order to dim both the bright
red giants and the background of faint red stars, hence alleviating the
crowding problems experienced by previous studies. Both filter and target
selection are critical for the success of this project, and no previous HST
program has an appropriate combination to allow proper motion measurements for
most stars into the very centers of crowded clusters. The velocity
measurements will allow us to: {i} place constraints on the mass of a central
black hole in each cluster {detailed calculations show that the proposed
observations are sufficient to detect any central black hole with a mass as
low as 3000 solar masses at the greater than 3 sigma level}; {ii} derive the
internal velocity dispersion as a function of cluster radius; {iii} verify or
reject previous reports of cluster rotation; and {iv} directly measure any
velocity anisotropy as a function of radius. If this project is not started
with HST now, it may not be possible again for several decades.

	    Survey of Nearby Galaxies
PI:         Rupali Chandar

Over 50% of galaxies in the local universe are spirals. Yet the star formation
histories and evolution of this crucial population remain poorly understood.
We propose to combine archival data with new ACS/WFC and WFPC2 observations of
11 galaxies, to tackle a comprehensive investigation of nearby spirals
covering the entire spiral sequence. The new observations will fill a serious
deficiency in HST's legacy, and maximize the scientific return of existing HST
data. The filter combination of UBVI, and Halpha is ideal for studying stellar
populations, dust properties, and the ISM. Our immediate scientific objectives
are: {i} to use the resolved cluster populations, both young massive clusters
and ancient globular clusters as a chronometer, to understand how spirals
assembled as a function of time; {ii} study the rapid disruption properties of
young clusters; and {iii} understand dust distributions in spirals from pc to
kpc scales. Each of these goals provides an important step towards charting
the evolution of galaxies, and an essential baseline for interpreting the
galaxy populations being surveyed in both the early and present universe. The
resolution of our survey, which exploits the excellent imaging capabilities of
HST's two optical cameras, will enable us to understand the record of star
cluster, and galaxy formation in a level of detail which is not possible for
more distant systems. Finally, the proposed observations will provide a key to
interpret an extensive, multiwavelength archive of space- and ground- based
data at lower spatial resolution {SPITZER, CHANDRA, GALEX, NICMOS P alpha and
H band imaging} for local spirals.

The Hubble Deep Field North has uninterupted observations at wavelengths from

propose to complete the UDF coverage with deep ultraviolet imaging of the
Ultra-Deep Field {UDF} with the ACS-SBC in the Far-UV {1500 Angstrom} and
WFPC2 in the Near-UV {F300W}. We will reach point source limits of ABmag=28.5,
a factor of ten fainter than the GALEX ultradeep surveys. Our dataset will add
to the value of the UDF legacy, and requires the unique capabilities of HST.
In the spirit of the UDF, we submit this proposal in the Treasury catagory. We
request a modest allocation of observing time for a Treasury program: 62
orbits. We will provide science quality images and photometric catalogs to
enable a range of research topics by the community. The science goals of the
team are to investigate the episode of strong star formation activity in
galaxies out to z=1, through the rest-frame FUV luminosity function and the
internal color structure of galaxies. Far-UV number counts suggest that
moderate redshift {z~0.5} starbursts are undergoing a single, rapid burst of
star-formation. We will investigate this result by measuring the faint-end
slope, alpha, of the luminosity function. We will measure the star formation
properties of moderate redshift starburst galaxies and compare their
morphologies in the UV, optical, and near-IR. This catalog of starbursts will
also be important to the astronomical community in correlating unobscured
star-formation with the sources detected in the Spitzer Space Telescope legacy
observations of the field. With the high spatial resolution data, will set
strict limits on the flux escaping in intermediate redshift {1<z<2} galaxies
at wavelengths below the rest-frame Lyman limit, and thus infer the

PI:         Andrew Zirm

To establish the epoch when galaxy environment manifests itself as a
large-scale evolutionary process, we propose to extend the study of galaxy
colors and morphologies to a protocluster at z=2.16.  Here the universe is
only 3 Gyrs old and significant differences are expected between scenarios
favoring a morphology-radius relation over a morphology-density relation.  In
addition, because the fractional age differences among cluster galaxies are
larger, study of the color-magnitude relation provides considerable leverage
for determining the epoch of early-type galaxy formation.  To facilitate
direct comparison to studies at lower redshift, one must probe the same
rest-frame wavelengths with high photometric accuracy and at similar physical
scales.  Its near-infrared photometric stability {low, constant background}
and ability to image large areas of sky at high angular-resolution {compared
to adaptive optics} makes HST/NICMOS ideal for this program.  Six pointings of
NICMOS camera 3 will result in rest-frame optical, high resolution images of
16 confirmed protocluster members, and an additional 60 candidate protocluster
members including 29 EROs.  These galaxies were selected with a variety of
techniques and span a range of projected radii within the protocluster.  The
proposed observations constitute a unique opportunity to extend the study of
galaxies in overdense regions to an early time in cosmic history.

Title:	    When did M31's disk form?
PI:         Heather Morrison

The recent discovery of THIN disk globular clusters in M31 provides a unique
opportunity to determine the age of M31's disk. The globular cluster
kinematics imply that the disk has not been significantly heated or destroyed
by a merger since they were formed. Thus the cluster ages provide a lower
limit to the disk age. This limit will complement the high-redshift data,
where few disk galaxies are currently known because of their relatively low
surface brighness. We propose to obtain BV ACS imaging of seven disk clusters
to below the level of the horizontal branch {HB} to determine the distribution
of evolved stars in the color-magnitude diagram. The contribution of evolved
stars, particularly blue HB stars, is crucial to estimating the age of the
globular cluster from both color-magnitude diagrams and the high S/N

PI:         Dean Hines

The polarimetry capability of the ACS will be used to image the extended
emission in the most extreme Hyperluminous Infrared Galaxy and Type-2 QSO:
IRAS F15307+3252. Ground-based imaging polarimetry reveals high polarization,
but does not have sufficient spatial resolution to resolve the source of the
polarization, much less elucidate its structure. Previous WFPC2 and ACS
observations without polarimetry optics reveal at least two companions and
extended emission near the QSO. However, the nature of this structure is
unknown. It could be powered by starburst light from an interaction, or it may
be debris lit by the central misdirected QSO. Our proposed observations will
completely remove this uncertainty. If the extended emission is the source of
polarized light, the observations will highly constrain its physical structure
and enable detailed modeling of this prototypical Type-2 QSO. If it is not the
source of polarized light, then the observations combined with previous HST
images will place very tight constraints on the stellar population {or line
emission} responsible for the emssion. Either way, as the most extreme object
of its class, the results will have a fundamental impact on our understanding
of the Hyperluminous Infrared Galaxy phenomenon which may be a dominant phase
of galaxies and QSOs in the high redshift universe.

	    light
PI:         Hans Olofsson

We have discovered that some nearby bright carbon stars have detached
circumstellar shells, emitting in CO mm lines as well as in visual stellar
light scattered by dust and atoms {the resonance lines of NaI and KI}. The
optical light is up to 35% linearly polarized. The shells are remarkably
spherical, but both the CO data and the optical pictures show pronounced
inhomogeneities on smaller {marginally resolved} scales. The latter fact
introduces considerable uncertainties in mass-loss-rate estimates. We ascribe
the existence of the shells to the He-shell flashes, and the inhomogeneities
to hydrodynamic instabilities. However, the different observables {CO, atoms,
dust} indicate significantly different structural patterns. In order to
understand the different components of the shells, their interaction and
origin, it is necessary to improve the imaging of the shells. In view of their
faintness, relative to the stellar light scattered in the Earth's atmosphere,
this can only be accomplished by using the HST. Maps of the distribution of
the dust at high spatial resolution will efficiently constrain theoretical
work on the origin of the shells and their evolution, and the inhomogeneities
in them. We may be able to separate the dust and atomic scattered light
components. Mass loss from carbon stars and other AGB stars contribute
significantly to the abundances of many chemical elements {C, N, s-elements}
and is not well understood. The present study may lead to important
improvements in the study of mass-loss rates and mechanisms, and thus for
nucleosynthesis in general.

 Try to understand the energies of normal galactic nuclei. Are the main
sources of ionizing radiation nonthermal, or due to a blue stellar population?
High spatial resolution of ST is essential to this problem; FOS spectra can
distinguish between a population of hot young stars or HB stars. Use the 0.3"
aperture at any central point sources and off nucleus at the appropriate spot
determined from WFPC data. Choose this spot within 1", along the major axis in

Title:	    Anisotropy and obscuration in the near-nuclear regions of powerful
	    radio galaxies
PI:         Clive Tadhunter

Despite the success of the orientation-based unified schemes for powerful
radio sources, we are still far from understanding the distribution of
obscuring material in the near-nuclear regions of such sources, and how this
distribution evolves with radio power. Following on from our highly successful
Cycle 7 pilot observations of Cygnus A, we propose a near-IR polarimetric
survey of a complete sample of powerful radio galaxies in order map the
near-nuclear illumination cones, and investigate the distribution of obscuring
material on a 0.1 to 1kpc scale. In particular, the observations will allow us
to test the "receding torus model'' which predicts that the opening angles of
the illumination cones are smaller in low redshift/low power radio galaxies
than in their high redshift/high power counterparts.We will also investigate
whether AGN- and jet-driven outflows have a substantial effect on distribution
of obscuring material by "hollowing out'' the quasar illumination cones in the
more powerful sources. Finally, by using our polarization maps to search for
signs of intrinsic anisotropy in the near-IR continuum within the cones, we
will investigate the geometry of the near-IR continuum emitting regions close
to the quasar nuclei. These observations are not only crucial for our
understanding of radio source unification, but also provide key information
about the effects of AGN-induced outflows on the ISM of the host galaxies.

Title:	    Catching optical emission from the first discovered double-pulsar
	    system: J0737-3039
PI:         francesco ferraro

This proposal is aimed to detect optical emission from one of the most
intriguing astronomical object ever found in the sky: the newly discovered
binary system harbouring two pulsar {PSR J0737-3039A and PSR J0737-3039B}.
This is the first double-pulsar system ever detected {Burgay et al. 2003; Lyne
et al. 2004} and it provides a wonderful laboratory for the study of
relativistic gravity and gravitational radiation. Moreover, for the first
time, it offers the opportunity to probe the magnetosphere and the local
environment of a neutron star. There is indeed evidence of strong interactions
between the energy released by one pulsar and the magnetosphere of the other.
Our team is now carrying out a multi-wavelength project to understand the
nature of the occurring interactions and the energy budget of the system. In
particular, while radio observations will continue to survey the object, X-ray
observations with Chandra have been already allocated. Here we ask for deep
ACS-HR observations to catch the optical emission from the system. These
observations will firstly estimate the optical nonthermal flux, and, once
combined with radio and X-ray fluxes, will give us unique insights into the
physics of the relativistic wind interactions within the system.

We have used the 2MASS near-infrared and FIRST radio surveys, together with
the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey plates to select a sample of dust-reddened,
radio-intermediate quasars. We wish to use ACS to study the host galaxies of
these quasars. The dust reddening of the quasars makes it possible to study
the hosts at rest-frame optical-UV wavelengths much more easily than the hosts
of normal quasars of similar bolometric luminosity. Our study will compare the
hosts of our dust-reddened quasars to those of normal quasars from the HST
archive to test the hypothesis that dust-reddened quasars are young objects,
whose hosts still show morphological evidence of recent merger events which
triggered the quasar.

This project addresses the fundamental issue of the age and abundance of the
stellar populations in early type galaxies. We propose deep imaging
observations with ACS/WFC in F606W, F814W, and NICMOS/NIC2 in F110W, F160W to
create optical/IR color-magnitude diagrams of the upper red giant branch in
the nearest example of a bona fide elliptical galaxy, NGC3379, and
simultaneously in the disk and halo of its companion, the S0 galaxy NGC3384.
These observations will build upon the results from our NICMOS study of
NGC3379, which produced the first deep IR color-magnitude data for a normal,
luminous elliptical galaxy. This is the most direct way to establish the
metallicity, metallicity spread, and presence of intermediate age populations
in these representative Hubble types, exploring their star formation histories
and evolution. The data will enable comparison with M32, the M31 halo,
NGC5128, and other nearby galaxies similarly observed with HST.

Title:	    A Proper Motion Study of the Ionized Gas in the Vicinity of the
	    Galactic Center Black Hole
PI:         Susan Stolovy

The Galactic Center's distance of only 8 kpc provides a unique opportunity to
study the interaction of a supermassive black hole with its environment at a
level of detail not possible for other galaxies. We propose to observe the
inner parsec of the Galaxy in the Paschen alpha line with Camera 1 of NICMOS
in order to study the kinematics of ionized gas in the vicinity of the
supermassive black hole coincident with Sgr A*. Our previous GO program 7842
yielded detailed Pa alpha images revealing complex, filamentary structure at
0.16 arcsec {0.006 pc} resolution. However, proper motions could not be
robustly derived from that data set due to the fact that the two epochs were
spaced only 7 months apart. In order to follow up on preliminary results
showing evidence for high proper motions within 2'' of Sgr A* and to
characterize the rest of the central parsec, we propose to obtain two
additional epochs within Cycle 13 so that the dataset will comprise
independent measurements of the proper motions ranging from intervals of 5
months to 7 years, with the 7 year interval giving a 1 sigma accuracy of 45
km/s. These will be combined with existing radial velocity measurements to
provide the first complete characterization of the kinematics of the ionized
gas in the central parsec. This is crucial to interpreting the relative
importance of gravitational forces, stellar winds, and possible accretion onto
or outflow from the black hole. These observations may possibly lead to the
first direct observation of gas in the process of accretion {or ejection via a
jet} associated with the Galactic Center black hole. The kinematics of the gas
may also imply that accretion may be inhibited, and this could explain the low
luminosity of Sgr A*.

Title:	    Star Formation Driven Outflows in Actively Star Forming Edge-on
	    Spiral Galaxies
PI:         Joern Rossa

We will investigate the disk-halo interaction in four actively star forming
edge-on spiral galaxies using the ACS. In recent years considerable progress
has been achieved in testing the disk-halo interaction scenario which
describes the large scale mass exchange of the ISM between disk and halo
including the metal enrichment of the IGM, which is on galactic scales
described by various theoretical models {e.g., galactic fountains, chimneys,
superwinds}. The investigation of nearby edge-on spirals in this respect
offers a particularly exciting perspective for a quantitative understanding of
this feedback provided by star formation on the ISM. Feedback is the crucial
ingredient in all models of galaxy formation and evolution. While commonly
implemented in simple terms {global energy or metal injection}, further
progress can only be achieved with a better understanding of the relevant
physics. This requires high spatial resolution studies of nearby galaxies.
Whereas groundbased observations are perfectly suited to study the overall
morphology of the outflowing gas, they are inadequate to describe the
structure on the smallest relevant scales. However, it is the small scale
structure that constrains the microphysics to be applied in theoretical models
of a multiphase medium. Galaxies spanning a wide range of star formation
activity have to be investigated in order to test which processes for the gas
ejection are at work. High spatial resolution studies, as can be achieved with
the ACS onboard HST and yielding a spatial resolution of 3-7 parsecs for the
four proposed target galaxies, will critically test the existing models for
the feedback process.

Title:	    Host Galaxies and Environments of the Most Massive Black Holes in

PI:         Xiaohui Fan

The existence of luminous quasars with billion solar mass black holes at high
redshift poses important questions about the relation between the formation
and evolution of the earliest galaxies and quasars in the universe: how could
these high-redshift black holes accrete matter so quickly and so efficiently?
Is the quasar phase connected to the formation of galactic bulge in the
earliest epoch? Was the black hole-bulge mass relation observed locally
already established at high-redshift? We will use ACS/WFC to obtain rest-frame
UV imaging of five quasars at z~4 with the highest estimated black hole mass,
of the order 10 billion solar masses. The goal of the HST observation is to
directly detect their host galaxies and to probe their galactic environment.
These quasars are likely among the most massive and luminous host galaxies at
high-redshift, providing ideal targets for direct detection. The rest-frame UV
properties measured with HST will be combined with rest-frame optical, mid to
far-IR oberservations of these quasars to measure the star-formation rate, to
estimate the stellar age and mass of the host galaxy, and to probe the
quasar/starburst connection, quasar triggering mechanism and relation between
black hole and bulge formation at the highest possible redshift. One of the
targets, PSS 2322+1944 {z=4.17}, is a gravitational lensed quasar with a
nearly complete Einstein ring in CO emission, providing a unique opportunity
to study the small scale structure of a high-redshift quasar host galaxy.

PI:         Alan Stockton

We have isolated a sample of 9 luminous {~2L*} galaxies with the very oldest
stellar populations at their respective redshifts. The galaxies have been
found in radio-source fields chosen to be at the key redshifts z~1.5 and
z~2.5, which allow the cleanest separation of old stellar populations from
highly reddened starbursts with colors derived from standard filter
combinations. Ground-based observations in excellent seeing and with adaptive
optics of 3 of these galaxies indicate that all 3 are dominated by well
relaxed disks of old stars, suggesting that the first large stellar systems to
form in the universe were disks in which star formation proceeded extremely
rapidly and efficiently. In order to test this conjecture, we are requesting
NICMOS2 exposures of our sample to obtain high S/N imaging in the F160W filter
to determine detailed morphologies of the old stellar population, coupled with
either NICMOS2 F110W or ACS F814W exposures {depending on redshift} to
determine color gradients and/or other systematic color variations that might
provide clues to formation processes.

NGC 604 is, together with 30 Doradus, the extragalactic prototype giant H II
region. Its stellar content and mass {~200 O+WR stars, ~10**5 M_Sun}, age
{~3.5 Myr}, proximity {840 kpc}, and low foreground extinction {E{B-V} <= 0.1}
make it an ideal object to study the massive stellar population of a scaled OB
association, its interaction with the surrounding medium, and the effects
caused by the strong differential extinction. We propose new HST observations
which, combined with existent ones, will provide the most thorough
multi-wavelength study of NGC 604 from the FUV to the NIR. We will obtain
spectral classifications for ~200 stars, measure their spectral energy
distributions from 1300 A to 2.2 microns, identify embedded very-young stellar
populations hidden inside dust clouds, measure the extinction law and its
possible variations as a function of environmental conditions, and analyze the
relationship between the hot stars and the surrounding gas. The new data we
are proposing is divided into three parts: {a} slitless objective-prism FUV
spectroscopy using ACS/SBC, {b} multi-filter {6 broad-band and 2 narrow-band}
NUV-optical imaging using ACS/HRC, and {c} HST/NICMOS broadband imaging. Our

MACSJ0717.5+3745 at z=0.55 in order to obtain the first direct detection of
cluster evolution through infall of matter along large-scale filaments.
Existing optical, X-ray, and groundbased weak-lensing data show strong
evidence of galaxy groups and dark matter in a coherent structure spanning at
least 10 arcmin {4/h Mpc, LCDM} in the plane of the sky. The size of this
object rules out prior interaction between the groups and the cluster, thus
making it a prime candidate for a genuine filament as opposed to a merger
remnant. The proposed observation will 1} allow the first direct measurement
of the dark matter content and mass distribution along a large-scale filament
via weak lensing, and 2} provide, through galaxy morphology and resolved
colour information, unprecedented insights into the physical processes and
environmental effects governing the transition from field to cluster galaxies.

Recent HST imaging of QSO host galaxies indicates that at least a large
fraction of QSOs reside in seemingly undisturbed elliptical hosts. However,
our deep Keck spectroscopy of a sample of these host galaxies indicates that
many of these objects were involved in a major starburst episode between 0.6
and 1.6 Gyr ago.   We propose to obtain very deep ACS WFC observations of the
five hosts in this sample that have the most reliable age determinations to
search for fine structure indicative of a past merger event and to test the
hypothesis that the elliptical hosts are the products of relatively recent
merger events rather than old galaxies which formed at high redshifts.	By
establishing a firm connection between	ancient mergers and the aging
starbursts in these classical QSOs, we will be able to estimate the  fraction
of the total QSO population that results directly from mergers accompanied by
massive starbursts and to place constraints on the duty cycle for QSO
activity.

characterize these changes using the HST ACS instrument to image Triton at UV,

from near Earth. By so doing, we will determine the resurfacing rates and set
model constraints on activity and surface temperature as well as composition.
Such constraints have profound implications for our understanding of Triton's

outer solar system satellites which may undergo similar geophysical processes
or have similar composition.

made with the Keck AO system in late 2003 show that the amount and
distribution of cloud activity is also unprecedented. In 1994, HST images
suggested that increased cloud activity on the disk was correlated with the
formation of a new northern Great Dark Spot {GDS} and the dissipation of the
Voyager GDS. Great Dark Spots are only detectable with HST blue-wavelength
images. In Cycle 12, no ACS or WFPC2 images of Neptune were obtained, and
exactly two STIS Neptune images were obtained {broad-band only}. The

We propose to determine the white dwarf cooling age in the nearest metal-poor
{[Fe/H]=-2} globular cluster, NGC 6397. This globular cluster provides the
best opportunity to test the white dwarf cooling age in such a metal-poor
system and at the same time provide a comparison with the more metal-rich
cluster {M4} which we recently successfully observed with HST. Any {or even
no} age difference between these clusters will be important in understanding
the age-metallicity relation for these systems which reflects the star
formation history in the early Galaxy. The absolute age is an important
cosmological constraint. We expect to be able to detect age DIFFERENCES
between these clusters at the 0.5 Gyr level and absolute ages should be
accurate to 1.0 Gyr. In addition, and in contrast with M4, NGC 6397 is highly
dynamically evolved, has a collapsed core, and the distribution of its white
dwarfs throughout the cluster have almost certainly been modified by dynamical
processes. We are using N-body simulations specifically developed for this
cluster to understand these modifications and to include their effects in our
measurement of the white dwarf luminosity function and cooling age. Among the
dynamical questions we expect to answer with this proposal are: 1} what was
the primordial binary frequency in NGC 6397? 2} can we explain the high
central concentration with a population of massive white dwarfs and/or neutron
stars? 3} do we see sufficient central binaries to reverse the core collapse

We can indirectly learn about the planet formation process by studying

on Herbig Ae/Be stars which are pre-main sequence intermediate mass stars
{2-10 solar masses} thought to be immediate precursors to the Vega-excess
stars like Beta Pictoris. We propose to take ACS coronagraphic images in the
F606W filter of 6 Herbig Ae/Be stars, all of which have well constrained
spectral energy distributions and are nearby {<200pc}, suggesting possible
disk sizes of 3" or larger in radius. We use the recent ACS coronagraph image
of Herbig Ae/Be star, HD 141569, which shows a spectacular circumstellar disk,
as a template for observing strategy and exposure time estimates. Our
observing program involves contemporaneous comparison stars that will be used
to subtract the point spread function. These images will constrain the size
and possibly, the morphology of the circumstellar dust that may have disk,
envelope or disk+envelope geometries. We will analyze these images
quantitatively using 2-Dust, an axisymmetric radiative transfer dust code, to

imaging to isolate the flux of the lens star from the contributions of
neighbouring "blended" stars within 1-2 arcsecs. This will allow us to
identify the nature of the lens star and hence determine the mass of the
stellar and planetary components. The lens is most likely a main sequence
star, but other possibilities cannot be ruled out. High resolution imaging

We propose to perform a deep search for new satellites in the Pluto-Charon

reach a sensitivity that is ~5.5 mag fainter than previous surveys, and we
will be able to detect objects that are only ~5 km in diameter, if they have
the same albedo as Pluto {50%}, and ~17 km if the albedo is similar to that of
cometary nuclei {4%}. The discovery of a satellite in the Pluto-Charon system
would be an exciting development in the burgeoning field of satellite
formation theory and would also provide critical mission support for the New
Horizons mission, which will be launched in January 2006 and will make a close
flyby of Pluto-Charon as early as July 2015. Pluto is approaching the Milky
Way, and observations near the time of this year's opposition will mitigate
the background confusion problem, which generally becomes worse during the
coming decade. The high spatial resolution of HST is ideal for this type of
search in crowded stellar fields, and the field-of-view of the ACS/WFC is
almost perfectly matched to the orbital stability radius of companions in the
Pluto-Charon system. One additional image, taken ~5 days after the first, is
needed to confirm that any detected objects are truly members of the
Pluto-Charon system. Thus, the entire program requires a total of only 2

We propose to use NICMOS imaging to measure the rest-frame optical/UV colours
of a complete sample of 10 QSO host galaxies at redshifts between z=1.5 and
z=2. From our cycle 11 HST observations {the GEMS project} we know that QSO
host galaxies at redshifts of z~1 show blue colours despite having early-type
morphologies. This is in excellent agreement with recent SDSS results on low-z
AGN hosts, suggesting that QSO-type activity in galaxies correlates strongly
with the presence of a young stellar population. Our proposed NICMOS
observations will allow us to test the validity of this hypothesis out to z~2,
by relating the observed QSO host colours to those of normal galaxies at
similar redshifts taken from GOODS. We have already established within GEMS
that the QSO hosts in our sample possess substantial UV luminosities, most
likely originating from young stars. Knowing rest-frame colours, we can
estimate stellar ages and stellar masses. For the first time will it be
possible to determine the evolution of stellar masses in QSO host galaxies
from z=2, the epoch of maximum QSO activity, to the present. Our results will
shed light on the relation between nuclear activity and the star formation
history of galaxies, and how these processes may jointly drive the cosmic

	    Concentration in the Local Universe
PI:         John Blakeslee

The 600 km/s motion of the Local Group {LG} with respect to the cosmic
microwave background {CMB} is now known to high accuracy. However, its precise
origin remains poorly understood. The contribution to the motion from the pull
of the rich Shapley supercluster at z = 0.048 is particularly controversial.
This extreme mass concentration contains more than 20 Abell clusters within 35
Mpc of its very rich central cluster A3558, and is recognized as both the
optically richest and the most X-ray luminous structure in the local {z < 0.1}
universe. Yet, published values for the mass of Shapley continue to differ by
an order of magnitude, and recent estimates of its pull on the LG range from
negligible {20 km/s} to highly significant {300 km/s or more}. Here we propose
to resolve this key issue by using ACS to measure high-precision surface
brightness fluctuation {SBF} distances in order to make a direct measurement
of the infall towards Shapley. We will target three Shapley foreground
clusters where the infall is expected to be high {possibly 1000 km/s or more},
as well as the Shapley core, in order to test the assumption that it is at
rest in the CMB. Prior to ACS, the Shapley region was unreachable for SBF, but
ACS doubles the distance range of the SBF method with HST, enabling the
distances to be measured to the required accuracy. The proposed measurements
will place a firm limit on the largest mass fluctuation in the nearby universe
and finally determine its contribution to the observed CMB dipole.

Title:	    SEARCH FOR EXTENDED GALACTIC HALOS (FOS 23): CYCLE 2 OBSERVATIONS
PI:         Ralph Bohlin

Use QSOs projected close to nearby galaxies to search for halos sufficiently
extended to explain the observed statistics of QSO absorption line spectra. 
Different candidate galaxies have been chosen, including some known to have
extended 21 cm halos, galaxies in and out of clusters, etc. Galaxies are
chosen with z>0.001 where possible, so that local Lyman alpha absorption can
be resolved from a galaxian column density of 2E19 of HI in our R=1200 mode.
This is a UV specific problem that requires ST collecting area. A positive
detection will produce a point on the rotation curve far into the galaxy halo,
as well as crude information on the physical conditions of the halo gas. Each
spectrum will also contain information on the gas distribution of our galaxy.

Title:	    Identifying the Major Star Formation Epoch{s} in the Outlying M31
	    Dwarf Spheroidal Companion Cassiopeia
PI:         Taft Armandroff

The Galaxy's dwarf spheroidal {dSph} companions show a surprising diversity in
the epochs of their major star formation episodes, which extend from ~15 to ~1
Gyr. For Galactic dSphs there is correlation between Galactocentric distance
and the prominence of intermediate-age {~2-10 Gyr} populations; the dSphs with
extended star formation lie at larger Galactocentric distance. This
correlation may also apply to M31's dSph companions. Our WFPC2 data {Da Costa
et al. 2000} show that And II lies at a true distance of between 160 and 230
kpc from M31, comparable to the Galactocentric distances of the Galaxy's outer
dSphs satellites, and further than the other M31 Companions studied in detail
so far. This dSph shows convincing evidence for an intermediate-age {~6-9 Gyr}
population, which the other well-studied M31 dSphs lack. Only the recently
discovered M31 dSphs companions And VI and Cassiopeia lie at larger distances
from the center of M31 than And II. The pri mary aim of this proposal is to
determine a color-magnitude diagram for the Cassiopeia dSph which reaches
below the horizontal branch. With these data we will constrain the epoch of
the main star formation episode in Cassiopeia, adding to our knowledge of how
star formation in dwarf galaxies is affected by the presence of a larger
neighbor. Additional results will include measurement of the true distance
from M31, mean abundance, abundance dispersion, and the variable star content.
With these observations, the investigation of the stellar populations down to
the horizontal branch of the known M31 dSphs with HST will be complete.

Title:	    A Search for Faint Companions of Altair
PI:         William Sparks

We propose to use the innovative new technique of spectral deconvolution
{Sparks & Ford 2002} to search for very faint companions, possibly extrasolar
planets shining by reflected light, around Altair, the nearest bright, single
star to the Sun. The technique offers a Poisson-limited detection capability
that brings Jovian-class planets into the realm of feasibility for a select
few stars. We turn the wavelength dependence of the coronagraphic PSF to
advantage and use it to eliminate stray light from the host star. As part of
the detection process, we obtain a spectrum over the wavelength range, 750 nm
to 1 micron, with 9% resolution. The search will be orders of magnitude more
sensitive than all previous efforts and should take us to within about an
order of magnitude of the Jovian luminosity flux limit.

Title:	    Precise Distances to Nearby Planetary Nebulae
PI:         George Benedict

We propose to carry out astrometry with the FGS to obtain accurate and precise
distances to four nearby planetary nebulae. In 1992, Cahn et al. noted that
``The distances to Galactic planetary nebulae remain a serious, if not THE
most serious, problem in the field, despite decades of study.'' Twelve years
later, the same statement still applies. Because the distances to planetary
nebulae are so uncertain, our understanding of their masses, luminosities,
scale height, birth rate, and evolutionary state is severely limited. To help
remedy this problem, HST astrometry can guarantee parallaxes with half the
error of any other available approach. These data, when combined with parallax
measurements from the USNO, will improve distance measurements by more than a
factor of two, producing more accurate distances with uncertainties that are
of the order of ~6%. Lastly, most planetary nebula distance scales in the
literature are statistical. They require several anchor points of known
distance in order to calibrate their zero point. Our program will provide
"gold standard" anchor points by the end of 2006, a decade before any
anticipated results from future space astrometry missions.

We are proposing to empirically calibrate the metallicity sensitivity of the

observed in nearby galaxies. 
To do this we will obtain the I-band Population II Tip of the Red Giant Branch
{TRGB} distances to two galaxies, NGC 3627 and NGC 3368, both of which have
comparable {Cepheid} distances of 11 Mpc and have almost identical {very high}
metallicities of 12 + log[O/H] = +9.3. 

At present, observers have extremely divergent views on the magnitude of the
metallicity effect on the Cepheid zero point, and theorists cannot even agee
upon the sign of the effect.

Title:	    Particle accelerators in space: resolving them for the first time
PI:         Almudena Prieto

The detection of optical counterparts of hot spots in radio galaxies has been
a challenge in astrophysics since the 1960s. Being located at several 100 kpc
away from the AGN, they represent the most striking sites of interaction
between the AGN ejecta and the ambient inter-galactic medium. Particle
acceleration is thought to drive their emission and therefore, due to their
remote locations, hot spots are the best laboratories to study the physics of
that mechanism in detail. Using carefully directed selection criteria and the
VLT we have discovered hot spots in the optical at an unprecedented detection
rate, all of them disclosing very intriguing structure. This structure
pinpoints the regions where electrons are accelerated to highly relativistic
energies -- the particle accelerators. With HST we aim at resolving these
accelerators for the very first time. This will enable us to establish the
nature and origin of these relativistic particles in the hot spots of radio
galaxies. The results of these studies not only represent a key for
understanding the evolution of radio sources but also provide important input
to plasma acceleration problems in general.

Title:	    Merger-Induced Populations in Early-Type Galaxy Cores
PI:         Robert O'Connell

Hierarchical formation models predict that early-type galaxies are built up
over an extended period from mergers of smaller systems, a process which
should leave long-lived signatures in their light profiles and stellar
population colors. Merger events should have continued up to relatively recent
times {the last 1-5 Gyr}, and many ellipticals and S0 bulges should therefore
show evidence of multiple, discrete, intermediate-age populations. Although
there is substantial observational support for a dissipational merger origin
for some early-type galaxies, most do not exhibit the expected anomalies in
either their light profiles or color distributions. However, existing searches
{mainly in the V and I bands} have not probed very deeply. Here we propose
high resolution, broad-band, near-ultraviolet {2500-3400 A} imaging of the
cores of bright early-type galaxies. This is the most sensitive probe
available for the detection of spatially-segregated, multiple population
components with ages in the range 1-5 Gyr. Our sample consists of dust- and
AGN-free systems with both normal and mildly anomalous central light profiles.
There is very little existing information on the near-UV structure of
early-type galaxies, and our program would effectively explore new terrain.

Title:	    Black Hole Growth and the Black Hole Mass -- Bulge Relations for
	    AGNs
PI:         Smita Mathur

Recent work has shown that the mass of a black hole is tightly correlated with
the bulge mass of its host galaxy. This relation needs to be understood in the
context of black hole growth in its active phase. Highly accreting AGNs, like
narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies {NLS1s}, are found to lie below the black hole
mass -- bulge velocity dispersion correlation of normal galaxies and broad
line AGNs. This result was obtained using FWHM{[OIII]} as a surrogate for the
bulge velocity dispersion. To test this result we propose to obtain high
resolution images of 10 NLS1s that do not lie on the black hole mass--sigma
relation and measure accurate bulge parameters {luminosity and effective
radius}. We will obtain an alternate handle on the bulge velocity dispersion
through the fundamental plane relations and also find the locus of these NLS1s
on the black hole mass--bulge luminosity plane. Testing this result is crucial
to understanding the role of accretion on black hole growth, the observed
correlations of the black hole mass with the bulge, and the formation and
evolution of galaxies.

PI:         Andrew Bunker

This proposal is to complete our program to identify the galaxies responsible
for the damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems {DLAs} at high redshift. By
combining both STIS {GO-8172, Moller et al. 2002} and NICMOS {GO-7824, Warren
et al. 2001} imaging with ground-based spectroscopy, we have been able to
develop a picture which unifies DLA galaxies and Lyman-break galaxies {Moller
et al. 2002}. However, the NICMOS observations failed {due to guide star
problems} for a key target - the three z>3 DLAs along the sightline of QSO
PC0953+4749. Of all the NICMOS targets in our DLA program, PC0953+4749 is
potentially the best, because it is the faintest quasar, allowing us to probe
the smallest impact parameters. Our Keck spectroscopy has revealed Lyman-alpha
emission from the z=3.4 DLA {Bunker et al. 2004} - the highest-redshift
example yet found. We also have a tentative detection of H-beta for this
system from UKIRT near-IR spectroscopy. NICMOS observations will enable us to
quantify the effects of dust and will provide the all-important sizes and
morphologies in the rest-frame optical down to H=26 at 5sigma. HST resolution
is essential because the Lyman-alpha emission source at z=3.4 has an impact
parameter of only 0.4"

Title:	    The Late Formation of Satellite Galaxies
PI:         Mary Putman

Tiny isolated HII regions have been discovered up to 30 kpc from the closest
galaxy in the NOAO Survey for Ionization in Neutral Gas Galaxies {SINGG}.
These halo HII regions can be ionized by only a few OB stars and seem to be
most commonly found in interacting systems. They may represent the beginning
of the formation of satellite galaxies at low redshift and/or are the source
of the numerous intracluster planetary nebula. The halo HII regions are a
unique mode of star formation in a low density and low metallicity environment
and high resolution HST images are required to identify their underlying
stellar populations. Determining the stellar populations of these HII regions
will establish whether in-situ star formation is a significant contributor to
the stellar content and enrichment of galactic halos and intergalactic space.
In particular, ACS/HRC observations are required for their resolution, UV
sensitivity, and wide wavelength coverage, allowing young and intermediate age
populations to be identified. Parallel ACS/WFC observations will explore the
possibility of a further stellar population in the interactive debris. The
results of this project have implications on the formation of satellite
galaxies, the origin of Galactic halo B stars, IGM ionization and enrichment,
and star formation principles.

very intense and rare flares in the X-rays leading to a significant increase
in its persistent X-ray emission. Should the source follow the trend observed
for a similar object, namely the AXP 1E2259+586, which exhibited IR and X-ray
emission rising and falling in tandem, this extreme current SGR activity is
probably the only source state, where we would be able to detect an IR
counterpart for Soft Gamma Repeaters.

taken before entering 2-Gyro mode should ideally be 2 days before this

generate the best offset but if it is longer there is a greater chance for an
intervening spot movement. One orbit is used to measure the light which gets
around the coronagraph in four filters. The second orbit is a test of the
repeatibility and the third orbit replicates the others but at a different
roll angle to permit a more detailed analysis of the coronagraphic
performance. We include two pairs of HRC earth flats, immediately following

This NICMOS calibration proposal tests the linearity of the detectors at count
rates falling at the low and high extremes of what is feasible. This program
is a response to the discovery that grism observations obtained with NIC3 show
a systematic offset from spectra taken with STIS and ACS in the 0.8-1.0 micron
overlap region. The observations are consistent with a NIC3 sensitivity that
depends on incident flux, i.e. count rate. By observing one bright star
{BD+17D4708, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey absolute standard} and two faint
stars {SNAP-2, a solar analog star; WD1657+343, a white dwarf} in a number of
filters we will check whether this is an intrinsic feature of the all NICMOS
detectors, something intrinsic to NIC3, or a result of a not understood effect
of the grism observations. We will furthermore be able to test whether the
effect has a wavelength dependence. The data will be reduced in exactly the
same fashion as has been done before for the photometric calibration program,
so a direct comparison with previous data can be made. In addition, we will
obtain extra spectroscopic data on WD1657+343, the faintest and best modeled
white dwarf of the stars on which the original discovery of the non-linearity
was made. This will reduce the errors in this spectrum from 5% to 2% and will
allow a better estimate of the effect. In order to ease scheduling, there are
no time constraints specified in the proposal. However, because of the
potentially important implications of this effect, it is very important that
these orbits be scheduled as soon as possible. They could be critical for the

Title:	    ACS and WFPC2 TGSMOV Two-Gyro PSF, Pointing, and Dither Test
PI:         John Biretta

12 orbits allocated. Currently only 7 orbits scheduled in this proposal
version. Other visits / orbits may be added pending results of F2G test and
managerial decisions. This version contains ACS/HRC with parallels in ACS/WFC
and NICMOS. No WFPC2 in this version. Goals: PSF, PSF repeatability, pointing
and stability within orbit and between orbits. Also test results for different
targets. {F2G requirements 1a, 1c, 2 , 4}. SCHEDULER: When activating this
proposal, please select one target and execute the four visits for that
target. Then select two more targets and execute only the first visit for
those. The visit names are encoded as follows: first letter = target {A =
NGC6341, B=NGC288, etc.} second letter = visit number {visit 1, 2, 3, or 4};
for example visit B2 is second visit on NGC288. Thus you might execute a set
of visits like D1, D2, D3, D4, K1, and L1. The actual targets should be
selected based their visibility during the TGSMOV test, and other potential
issues such as guide star availability. If target NGC6341 is available {visits
A1, A2, A3, and A4} please give it priority over the other targets. From
running the targets in the Phase I 2-gyro APT we think they will schedule
roughly as follows: April2005 use targets F, G, I. May 2005 use targets G, H,
I. June 2005 use targets B, C, J. July - August 2005 use targets B, C, D, E.
September 2005 use targets B, D, K, L. October 2005 use targets D, K, L, M.
For time periods after October 2005 we may need to add additional targets /
visits. But these dates are only a guidline. Use any targets that schedule
properly.

 WF/PC interference filter pictures will be used to resolve the shells of
planetary nebulae in the LMC and to resolve the shell of K648 in M15. The
angular diameters of the shells will be combined with echelle expansion
velocities to derive the ages of nebulae. Ultraviolet spectra of the central
stars will be used to derive the stars' effective temperatures and magnitudes,
with objective of placing the stars on evolutionary tracks in an M-Teff
diagram. UV spectra of the LMC nebulae, K648, and the brightest nebula in M32,
NGC205, and NGC185 will be used to derive chemical compositions and physical
conditions in the nebulae.

This test of the coronagraphic procedure will be run soon after entering the
two gyro mode. It duplicates observations that have been taken in normal
3-gyro mode in proposals 9667 or 9668 and is simalar to the 2-Gyro test of Feb
2005. One orbit is used to measure the light which gets around the coronagraph
in four filters. The second orbit is a test of the repeatibility and the third
orbit replicates the others but at a different roll angle to permit a more
detailed analysis of the coronagraphic performance. We include two pairs of
HRC earth flats, immediately following the coronagraphic observations, taken
with the coronagraph in place to measure the exact position of the spot, which
sometimes moves several pixels. The coronagraphic observations include a USE
OFFSET incorporating the information gained from the earth flats. The actual
execution date is unknown, but the indicated target has been chosen top be
observable in August. If necessary, a new target will be selected before the
observation. ***** SCHEDULERS ***** Please choose either visits 1-5, 11-15, or

This proposal is mainly aimed at analysing the NICMOS PSF under 2-gyro
operations. This will be mainly done via NIC1 observations, though back up
NIC2 observations are also implemented. The stability of the PSF will be
studied at two different time scales, with relatively long {~450sec} and short
{5 sec} exposures. The selected object, NGC1850, is a star cluster which has
been previously observed with NICMOS during SMOV3b. By observing a cluster we
will be able to measure several stars at once and, a part from the PSF
characterization, it will allow us to obtain the plate scale, field rotation,
and field distortion.

PI:         Alfred Schultz

Coronagraphic acquisition should not be affected by transitioning from 3-gyro
to 2-gyro mode guiding. However, coronagraphic performance is dependent upon
positioning of a target within the coronagraphic hole and the ability to
obtain a second observation with a roll of the telescope within the same
visibility period. Observations of a bright target are needed to verify and
confirm the coronagraphic performance, the ability to suppress the diffractive
energy background and the stability to image coronagraphically occulted
targets at two field orientations {rolls}.

Title:	    The Galactic Bulge Deep Field: A Planetary Transit Survey and Very
	    Deep Stellar Mass Function
PI:         Kailash Sahu

We propose to observe a Galactic bulge field continuously with ACS/WFC over a
7-day period. We will monitor ~167, 000 F, G, and K dwarfs down to V=23, in
order to detect transits by orbiting Jovian planets. If the frequency of "hot
Jupiters" is similar to that in the solar neighborhood, we will detect over
100 planets, more than doubling the number of extrasolar planets known. For
the brighter stars with transits, we will confirm the planetary nature of the
companions through radial- velocity measurements using the 8-m VLT. We will
determine the metallicities of most of the planet-bearing stars as well as a
control sample, through follow-up VLT spectroscopy. The metallicities of the
target stars range over more than 1.5 dex, allowing for a determination of the
dependence of planet frequency upon metallicity--a crucial element in
understanding planet formation. We will be able to discriminate between the
equally numerous disk and bulge stars via proper motions. Hence we will
determine, for the first time, the frequencies of planets in two entirely
different stellar populations. We will also determine for the first time the
distribution of planetary radii for extrasolar planets for both these
populations. Parallel observations with NICMOS will provide ultra-deep
near-infrared images of a nearby bulge field, which will be used to determine
the stellar luminosity and mass functions down to the brown-dwarf regime. The
data will also be useful for a variety of spinoff projects, including a census
of variable stars and of hot white dwarfs in the bulge, and the metallicity
distribution of bulge dwarfs.

Title:	    SEARCHING FOR LIGHT ECHOES AFTER THE SGR 1806-20- HYPERFLARE
PI:         Roberto Mignani

On 2004 December 27, the ``magnetar'' candidate SGR1806-20 experienced a giant
flare, the third detected from Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters since 1979 {GCN
Circulars #2920, #2922}. This was by far the most luminous flare ever observed
from a Galactic high energy source {more than 10^46 erg/s}. Following this
event, SGR1806-20 was observed and detected in the radio band {GCN # 2928,
#2930} and resolved into two parts: a point-like and a diffuse component. Our
team, based on the radio position, detected the probable IR counterpart , the
first IR counterpart ever for a SGR, by using the VLT NACO observations
carried out in 2004 {ATel #278}. This DDT proposal is aimed at {a} studying,
in the IR band, the afterglow diffuse component {linked to the giant flare
event}, its shape and expansion rate as a function of time, {b} tracing back
the flux at the onset of the flare through the detection and study of its
scattered-light echoes, {c} searching for jet--like structures.

Title:	    Jupiter's Upper Stratospheric Hazes Probed with Ganymede
PI:         Erich Karkoschka

I propose to observe a disappearance of Ganymede behind the dark limb of
Jupiter with five filters of the ACS/HRC camera.  Two exposures in each filter
can be taken during such an event.  The images will provide the spectral
variation of the altitude of the apparent limb of Jupiter.  The altitude of
the apparent limb is dependent on the presence of hazes in Jupiter's
stratosphere.  Hazes of vertical optical depths below 0.001 could be detected
with these observations, providing an extremely sensitive probe of high hazes.
 The observations probe altitudes levels near the 1-mb pressure level, for
which we have very limited data.
The creation of aerosols, their growth, and their transport by winds is
currently a mostly theoretical study.  It would significantly benefit from
constraints derived from the proposed observations.  ACS/HRC is the only
instrument capable of the required spatial resolution in the ultraviolet. 
Furthermore, a favorable geometry of Ganymede's orbit occurs only once every
six years.  This proposal achieves unique results with a minimum of HST time.

We propose a series of observations of the periodic comet 9P/Tempel 1 in
conjunction with NASA's Deep Impact mission. This mission is a spacecraft that
will release a 360 kg impactor into the nucleus of the comet on July 4, 2005.
Our primary objective is to study the generation and evolution of the gaseous
coma resulting from this impact. To this end we plan to obtain ultraviolet
spectra with STIS before, during, and following the impact. As a secondary
objective we will obtain wide-band images of the visual outburst resulting
from the impact. We also plan to use the high resolution capability of the
ACS/HRC, in conjunction with the camera on board the spacecraft, two weeks
prior to impact, to determine the spatial orientation of active jets emanating
from the comet's nucleus and to assess the potential hazards of these jets to
the spacecraft.

Title:	    Tracking the Evolution of a Knotty, High- Speed Jet in the Carbon
	    Star, V Hydrae
PI:         Raghvendra Sahai

The carbon star V Hydrae is experiencing heavy mass loss as it undergoes the
transition from AGB star to pre-planetary nebula. This is possibly the
earliest object known in this brief phase. Molecular observations reveal that
a bipolar nebula has been established even at this early stage. Using STIS on
the HST, we have discovered a high-velocity {> 200 km/s} jet or blob of gas
which was ejected only ~2 years ago from near the star. A second STIS
observation 11 months later clearly showed both its proper motion and the fact
that it is being strongly decelerated. We propose STIS monitoring of this
remarkable event for an additional 3 years, in order to: 1} obtain a precise
dynamical and cooling history of this blob, and 2} determine whether the
ejection of such blobs is associated with, or perhaps phased with, the 530-day
stellar period. This ejection event is likely to hold the key to understanding
why initially spherical mass outflows adopt a bipolar geometry during the
post-AGB phase of stellar evolution. We not only have the opportunity to look
on as the circumstellar envelope is sculpted by this and perhaps other
collimated mass ejections, but we also have an unprecedented chance to
constrain the mechanism for mass ejection, and thereby help solve a
long-standing puzzle. Finally, molecular line observations and our previous
STIS H$lpha$ observations show that the V Hya system contains a prominent,
central disk. We propose a follow-up study in H$lpha$ in order to better
define the disk properties, and thereby to determine whether the disk plays a
role in the collimation of the emerging blob. We will use the data to
constrain hydrodynamical models of collimated jet interactions with the
ambient circumstellar medium in V Hydrae, in order to set quantitative
constraints on the physical properties of the blobby outflow.

This is the second epoch of GO-9815, whose first-epoch abstract was: We
propose a photometric study of the lowest part of the main sequence of NGC
6791, an old, rich open cluster whose metallicity is considerably higher than
solar. The cluster is rich enough that a single ACS/WFC field will have ample
stars for the study. For the faintest stars, proper-motion separation of
cluster from field is essential; hence we include Cycle 14 observations. These
should give us a color-magnitude diagram and luminosity function that reach
into the region of the hydrogen-burning limit, thus extending the study of the
latter into a new domain of metallicity. Observational data of this type will
allow theoreticians to check many aspects of their theories of stellar
structure. We also expect to see the white dwarf sequence of the cluster. Our
team has experience with studies of this type, and has provided the
geometric-distortion calibration of ACS.

Title:	    SagDIG: a benchmark for understanding star formation in extreme

PI:         Yazan Momany

A long-standing question in the field of galaxy evolution is whether
metal-poor star-forming galaxies {like I ZW 18} posses a very old {>10 Gyr}
stellar population. An excellent example of such a primordial galaxy is the
Sagittarius dwarf irregular {SagDIG}. Besides being very metal-poor, this
object is exceptionally rich in atomic gas and shows evidence of propagating
star formation. Such features make of SagDIG and ideal target for the study of
star formation and its triggering mechanism in extremely metal-poor
environments. The deep, wide-field imaging capability of ACS is able to detect
an unprecedented number of the oldest stellar population. Such data will
enable the construction of both the star formation and chemical enrichment
history. In particular, determining the epoch of formation of the first stars
in such objects places a constraint on heirarchical galaxy formation in
"bottom up" cosmologies.

Title:	    Rings of Uranus: Dynamics, Particle Properties and Shepherding
	    Moons
PI:         Mark Showalter

We propose to image the rings and small inner satellites of Uranus using the
High Resolution Channel of the ACS. The revolutionary capabilities of the ACS
will allow us to address a variety of important questions relating to ring
properties and ring-moon interactions. Observations at a range of wavelengths
and phase angles will reveal the opposition surges of these rings and moons,
providing information on color and surface structure. Measurements of the ring
in front of the planet will provide complementary information on optical
depth; any variations of optical depth with wavelength will reveal the rings'
poorly-constrained population of embedded dust. The rings of Uranus are
closing rapidly as the planet approaches equinox in 2007, an event that takes
place only every 42 years. Using this opportunity, our observations will be
repeated at different solar and terrestrial tilt angles; this sequence of
images will be particularly valuable for constraining the physical thickness
and packing density of the rings. We will place particular emphasis on the
rotational variations of the Epsilon Ring, whose radial width {and therefore
its packing density} varies by a factor of five. In addition, deep exposures
through the CLEAR filter will enable us to detect and recover 4-5 km moons in
or near the ring system. Dynamicists invoke numerous such moons to "shepherd"
the many sharp ring boundaries, so this will serve as a definitive test of the
theory.

PI:         Gordon Drukier

We propose to make observations that directly test the proposition that
globular clusters contain massive black holes. Our targets are the bulge
globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. These are probably among the most
massive  in the galaxy, but are understudied compared to more familiar objects
such as M15. Our analysis suggests that these two clusters are the most likely
to show unambiguous evidence for a central massive black hole if such things
exist in globular clusters. The observations proposed will give us the first
thorough kinematic and photometric studies of these two clusters. The
combination of the two epochs will give us proper motions good to of order 6
km/s. In addition, they will provide us with the first good, deep,
color-magnitude diagrams for these clusters. These diagrams will be used to
investigate the make up of the stellar population in the clusters, to more
firmly establish their distances, ages, and metallicities, and to search for a

PI:         Nathan Smith

We propose an H-alpha ACS imaging survey covering 540 square arcminutes of the
Carina Nebula, including an unbiased survey of the bright core, and several
prominent dust pillars in the rich southern region of the nebula. Carina
provides an important link between well-studied nearby H II regions like
Orion, and more distant mini-starbusts like 30 Doradus. CVZ orbits will allow
extremely efficient use of HST to map a large area of this complex and
important region -- more than 95 percent of the proposed survey will be
observed by HST for the first time. This survey will provide a complete census
of microjets, proplyds, and silhouette disks with diameters as small as 200
AU, enough to spatially resolve disks like those in Orion, and will provide
the first catalog of outflows {jets} from embedded low-mass stars, thin
filamentary shocks, and wind-wind collisions in Carina. An accurate census of
these phenomena is needed to characterize the star formation activity and gas
dynamics as a function of position in the nebula, and to determine if models
for protoplanetary disk evaporation from Orion are applicable in more extreme
regions. Our previous ground-based optical and IR surveys have already
revealed dozens of candidates for this type of activity -- but this is just
the tip of the iceberg. Our proposed HST/ACS survey promises to be a bonanza
for understanding ongoing low-mass star formation influenced by extremely
high-mass stars.

Title:	    Accurate Mass Determination of the Ancient White Dwarf   ER 8
	    Through Astrometric Microlensing
PI:         Kailash Sahu

We propose to determine the mass of the very cool white dwarf ER 8 through
astrometric microlensing. We have predicted that ER 8 will pass very close to
a 15th-mag background star in January 2006, with an impact parameter of less
than 0.05 arcsec. As it passes in front, it will cause a deflection of the
background star's image by >8 milliarcsec, an amount easily detectable with
HST/FGS. The gravitational deflection angle depends only on the distances and
relative positions of the stars, and on the mass of the white dwarf. Since the
distances and positions can be determined precisely before the event, the
astrometric measurement offers a unique and direct method to measure the mass
of the white dwarf to high accuracy {<5%}. Unlike all other stellar mass
determinations, this technique works for single stars {but only if they are
nearby and of sufficient mass}. The mass of ER 8 is of special interest
because it is a member of the Galactic halo, and appears to be the oldest
known field white dwarf. This object can thus set a lower limit on the age of
the Galactic halo, but since white-dwarf cooling rates depend on their masses,
the mass is a necessary ingredient in the age determination. As a byproduct,
we will obtain an accurate parallax for ER 8, and thus its luminosity and
{from its effective temperature} its radius. Such quantities are at present
rather poorly known for the coolest white dwarfs, and will provide strong
constraints on white-dwarf physics.

The O-type star 15 Mon {HD 47839} was recently discovered to be an astrometric
and spectroscopic binary with a period of 25 years; it is the first known
O-star system to bridge the observational gap between the period regimes
normally probed by these techniques. An analysis of both the radial velocity
curve and astrometric orbit yields the masses of the components and distance
to the system. Continuing radial velocity and HST/FGS astrometric measurements
will lead to a definitive orbit and yield key information about the masses of
O-type stars. FGS TRANS mode measurements of separation, position angle, and
magnitude difference {begun in Cycle 5} are needed to link existing speckle
observations and anticipated observations with the CHARA Array optical
interferometer. In addition, field astrometry measurements {FGS POS mode} will
provide the proper motion, parallax, and the binary motion around the center
of mass. The POS data will provide an accurate estimate of the mass ratio and
an improved estimate of distance, and taken together with the spectroscopic
and astrometric orbital data, we will obtain masses for both components
accurate to a few percent.

Title:	    Dynamical Masses and Radii of Four White Dwarf Stars
PI:         Edmund Nelan

The cool white dwarf stars WD1639+153 and WD1818+126 were recently resolved by
HST FGS1r to be double degenerate binary systems with projected separations of
112 mas and 174 mas respectively. At a distance of less than 50 pc they may
both have periods shorter than about 20 years, making them ideal candidates
for follow up studies for dynamical mass determinations. This will increase
the number of white dwarfs with dynamical mass measurements from the current 4
up to 8. Continued observations of these white dwarfs along with nearby field
stars with the FGS will accuractely determine the orbital elements and
parallax of each system. The mass and radius of all four white dwarfs can be
determined to an unprecedented 1%, making it possible to test and calibrate
the theoretical white dwarf mass radius relation at the cool end of the
cooling curve for the DA and DC subclasses. Since the components of the binary
are coeval, once the mass and radius, and hence the cooling age of each star
is known, it will be possible to estimate the relation between the initial
mass and final mass for all four white dwarfs. We are requesting a total of 4
HST orbits per year for the next three cycles to initiate the process that
will result in a determination of the mass and radius of the four white
dwarfs.

PG 0122+200 is a pulsating hot white dwarf that is believed to radiate more
energy as neutrinos than it does as photons. We propose to measure with FGS
the trigonometric parallax of PG 0122+200 and thereby determine its distance,
luminosity, and mass. Ongoing investigations from the ground will infer the
neutrino luminosity through its effect on the pulsation periods, thus testing
standard and non-standard lepton theory, but the stellar mass must first be
known. The pulsation spectrum of PG 0122+200 admits two alternative
seismological interpretations, each implying a different mass, luminosity, and
distance. Measurement of an accurate distance will resolve the matter once and
for all and precisely determine the stellar mass. This project represents the
first test of lepton physics in dense {log rho = 6} plasma and is relevant to
the many areas of stellar physics in which neutrino interactions are
important, including recent theories intended to solve the solar-neutrino

The ages of the oldest stars are a key constraint on the evolution of our
Galaxy, the history of star formation, and cosmological models. These ages are
usually determined from globular clusters. However, it is alternatively
possible to determine ages of extreme Population II subgiants in the solar
neighborhood based on trigonometric parallaxes, without any recourse to
clusters. This approach completely avoids the vexing issues of cluster
distances, reddenings, and chemical compositions. There are 3 known nearby,
extremely metal-deficient Pop II subgiants with Hipparcos parallax errors of
6-11% which are available for such age determinations. At present, based on
the latest isochrones, the derived ages of these stars {HD 84937, HD 132475,
and HD 140283} are all close to 14 Gyr, uncomfortably close to or higher than
current estimates of the age of the universe. However, the errors in the
Hipparcos parallaxes imply uncertainties of at least 2 Gyr in the ages of the
3 stars. We propose to measure parallaxes of these three Pop II subgiants
using HST's Fine Guidance Sensor 1R. We expect to reduce the Hipparcos
parallax error bars by factors of 5-6, providing the most stringent test yet
of current theoretical stellar models of Pop II stars and pushing the age
uncertainties to below 0.5 Gyr. These data will also provide a major new
constraint on the distance scale of globular clusters, with wide implications
for stellar evolution and the calibration of Pop II standard candles.

Title:	    HST Observations of Astrophysically Important Visual Binaries
PI:         Howard Bond

This is a continuation of a project begun in Cycle 7 and continued up through
Cycle 11.  The program consists of annual or biannual WFPC2 or FGS
observations of three visual binary stars that will ultimately yield
fundamental astrophysical results, once their orbits and masses are
determined. 
     Our targets are the following: {1} Procyon {P = 41 yr}, for which our
first WFPC2 images yielded an extremely accurate angular separation of the
bright F star and its much fainter white-dwarf companion.  Combined with
ground-based astrometry of the bright star, our observation significantly
revised downward the derived masses, and brought Procyon A into excellent
agreement with theoretical evolutionary tracks for the first time.  With the
continued monitoring proposed here, we will obtain masses to an accuracy of
better than 1%, providing a testbed for theories of both Sun-like stars and
white dwarfs.  {2} G 107-70, a close double white dwarf {P = 19 yr} that
promises to add two accurate masses to the tiny handful of white-dwarf masses
that are directly known from dynamical measurements.  {3} Mu Cas {P = 21 yr},
a famous metal-deficient G dwarf for which accurate masses will lead to the
stars' helium contents, with cosmological implications.

Title:	    Trigonometric Calibration of the Period- Luminosity Relations for
	    Fundamental and First-Overtone Galactic Cepheids
PI:         Howard Bond

Cepheids are the primary distance indicators for the extragalactic distance
scale and the Hubble constant. The Hubble Constant Key Project set the
zero-point for their Cepheid distance scale by adopting a distance to the LMC,
averaged over a variety of techniques. However, different methods give an LMC
distance modulus ranging from 18.1 to 18.8, and the uncertainty in the Cepheid
zero-point is now the largest contributor to the error budget for H_0.
Moreover, the low metallicity of the LMC raises additional concerns, since the
PL relation probably depends on metallicity. The zero-point can be determined
from Hipparcos parallaxes of Galactic Cepheids out to several hundred parsecs,
but with a typical parallax error of 0.5-1 mas, the Hipparcos error bars are
uncomfortably large for this demanding application. By contrast, HST's FGS1R
interferometer can achieve astrometric accuracy of 0.2 mas. We propose to use
FGS1R to determine trigonometric parallaxes for a sample of 9 nearby Cepheids,
including both fundamental {F} and first-overtone {FO} pulsators. We show that
the improvement in the PL relations for F and FO Cepheids will be dramatic. We
will determine the PL slopes from our nearby solar- metallicity sample alone,
without recourse to nearby galaxies and the issue of [Fe/H] dependence. The
zero-point will be determined robustly to about 0.05 mag, based on accurate,
purely geometrical measurements. All of this can be achieved in the next few
years with HST, without having to wait for the technically demanding and risky
SIM and GAIA missions well into the next decade.

PI:         Bo Reipurth

We propose to study the shortlived event when a high-velocity protostellar
outflow collides with a dense molecular cloud core. It has recently been
realized that Herbig-Haro flows can attain gigantic proportions, with flow
lobes stretching over many parsecs. This greatly increases the probability
that an outflow rams into an obstacle such as a molecular cloud core as it
plows through the interstellar medium. The HH 110 flow represents the rare
case of an outflow that has suffered a grazing collision with a cloud core.
Fortunately, the resulting shock is so bright that only a few orbits are
required for analysis. ACS imaging in Halpha in Cycles 12 and 14 will permit
the study of detailed structure and kinematics of the flow as it passes
through the region of impact. This study has consequences for our general
understanding of the energy cycle and chemical processing of the interstellar
medium, turbulence in molecular clouds, and the role of sequential star
formation among low mass stars.

PI:         Mariangela Bernardi

We are proposing an HST snapshot survey of 40 objects with velocity dispersion
larger than 350 km/s, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and confirmed
to be single massive galaxies by the ACS-HRC i-band imaging obtained during
Cycle 13. This sample of the most massive galaxies in the Universe is
interesting because these objects potentially harbor the most massive black
holes, and because their existence places strong constraints on galaxy
formation models. These objects are unusual for another reason than their
abnormally large velocity dispersions: they appear to be bluer than expected
from extrapolation of the color-velocity dispersion relation of normal
early-types to these large velocity dispersions. The bluer than expected
colors indicate that the formation histories of these objects are likely to be
rather different than for normal early-types. This difference is also expected
to manifest as abnormal color-gradients. ACS-HRC imaging in one other band
{i.e. the g-band} will allow us not simply to analyze color gradients in these
objects but also to study their color texture and topology. This study will
provide important information about the formation history of galaxies.

Title:	    Imaging Extended UV H2 Emission Around T Tauri
PI:         Alexander Brown

The interactions between the circumstellar disk, newly-forming star, and
bipolar jet outflows play a central role in the process of star formation.
These interactions control how disks evolve and dissipate, and, thereby,
control the process of planetary system formation. We shall image the UV
molecular hydrogen {H2} emission around the pre-main-sequence binary star T
Tauri using the ACS SBC {solar blind channel} MAMA detector, thus determining
the spatial properties of the H2 emitting regions, and deriving important
detailed observational information on the disk-star-jet interaction on scales
of order 5 AU. These images will reveal the degree of collimation and opening
angles of the innermost parts of the high velocity jets, the shock structure
within the jet outflows, the size and morphology of the circumstellar disks,
both in emission and in silhouette, and the conditions inside the polar
cavities swept clear by Herbig-Haro flows. Fluorescent H2 emission lines
dominate the UV spectrum of T Tau. Long-slit {1-D} STIS UV spectra of T Tau
show H2 emission with a complex spatial structure extending many arcseconds
from the star and the presence of significant shock structures. The H2 must be
warm {approx. 2000 K} for the fluorescence to operate. The molecular emission
originates in shocks and, perhaps, also from the surfaces of the inner regions
of accretion disks.

spans the redshift range between 0.3-0.7 and almost 2 orders of magnitude of
X-ray luminosity,  with a median luminosity of 10^44 erg/s {0.5-2.0 keV}.
These snapshots will be used to obtain a fair census of the morphologies of
cluster galaxies in the cores of intermediate redshift clusters, to detect
radial and tangential arc candidates, to detect optical jet candidates, and to
provide an approximate estimate of the shear signal of the clusters themselves
and a potential assessment of the contribution of large scale structure to

PI:         Thomas Erben

We propose to obtain deep, multi-colour imaging for the galaxy cluster RX
J1347-1145 at z=0.45. Together with our high-quality ground-based optical and
X-ray data sets already at hand this observation will produce a precise mass
determination of this most X-ray luminous cluster. The analysis will mainly be
carried out by a newly developed and novel technique that combines weak and
strong lensing information and which is able to break the mass-sheet
degeneracy that hampered most previous lensing mass determinations. Within our
extensive campaign to understand the mass properties of RX J1347-1145, the
main goal of the ACS images will be a refined, high-resolution lensing mass
reconstruction of the cluster core. This will be achieved by a substantially
increased number density of background sources for a weak lensing analysis in
combination with constraints from multiply lensed images that are identified
with morphology and colour information. Both of these require the unique
resolving power of ACS. RX J1347-1145 is an ideal candidate for elucidating
the discrepant mass estimates obtained from traditional methods. It plays the
same role at high redshift as A1689 at intermediate redshifts for which a
similar analysis has been performed with ACS. Our results will therefore be an
important ingredient in the use of galaxy clusters as cosmological probes.

Title:	    A Survey for Supernovae in Massive High-Redshift Clusters
PI:         Avishay Gal-Yam

We propose to measure, to an unprecedented 30% accuracy, the SN-Ia rate in a
sample of massive z=0.5-0.9 galaxy clusters. The SN-Ia rate is a poorly known
observable, especially at high z, and in cluster environments. The SN rate and
its redshift dependence can serve as powerful discrimiminants for a number of
key issues in astrophysics and cosmology. Our observations will: 1. Put clear
constraints on the characteristic SN-Ia "delay time," the typical time between
the formation of a stellar population and the explosion of some of its members
as SNe-Ia. Such constraints can exclude entire categories of SN-Ia progenitor
models, since different models predict different delays. 2. Help resolve the
question of the dominant source of the high metallicity in the intracluster
medium {ICM} - SNe-Ia, or core-collapse SNe from an early stellar population
with a top-heavy IMF, perhaps those population III stars responsible for the
early re-ionization of the Universe. Since clusters are excellent laboratories
for studying enrichment {they generally have a simple star-formation history,
and matter cannot leave their deep potentials}, the results will be relevant
for understanding metal enrichment in general, and the possible role of first
generation stars in early Universal enrichment. 3. Reveal, via nuclear
variability, the AGN fraction in clusters at this redshift, to be compared
with the field AGN fraction. This will be valuable input for understanding
black-hole demographics, AGN evolution, and ICM energetics. 4. Potentially
discover intergalactic cluster SNe, which can trace the stripped stellar
population at high z.

Title:	    Imaging the mass structure of distant lens galaxies
PI:         Leon Koopmans

The surface brightness distribution of extended gravitationally lensed arcs
and Einstein rings contains super-resolved information about the lensed
object, and, more excitingly, about the smooth and clumpy mass distribution of
the lens galaxies. The source and lens information can non-parametrically be
separated, resulting in a direct "gravitational-mass image" of the inner
mass-distribution of cosmologically-distant galaxies {Koopmans 2005}.

With this goal in mind, we propose deep HST ACS-F555W/F814W and NICMOS-F160W
imaging of 15 gravitational-lens systems with spatially resolved lensed
sources, selected from the 17 new lens systems discovered by the Sloan Lens
ACS Survey {Bolton et al. 2004}. Each system has been selected from the SDSS
and confirmed in a time-efficient HST-ACS snapshot program {cycle-13}; they
show highly-magnified arcs or Einstein rings, lensed by a massive early-type
lens galaxy. High-fidelity multi-color HST images are required {not delivered
by the 420-sec snapshot images} to isolate these lensed images {properly
cleaned, dithered and extinction-corrected} from the lens galaxy surface
brightness distribution, and apply our "gravitational-mass imaging" technique.

The sample of galaxy mass distributions - determined through this method from
the arcs and Einstein ring HST images - will be studied to: {i} measure the
smooth mass distribution of the lens galaxies {Dark and luminous mass are
separated using the HST images and the stellar M/L values derived from a joint
stellar-dynamical analysis of each system}; {ii} quantify statistically and
individually the incidence of mass-substructure {with or without obvious
luminous counter-parts such as dwarf galaxies}. Since dark-matter substructure
should be considerably more prevalent at higher redshift, both results provide
a direct test of this prediction of the CDM hierarchical structure-formation
model.

accretion onto the cD's billion solar mass nuclear black hole, which grew
heavier by roughly 1/3 during the outburst. We intend to examine the
morphology and nuclear environment of the host galaxy to understand the

We propose a novel HST approach to obtain a dramatically more useful "dust
free" Type Ia supernovae {SNe Ia} dataset than available with the previous
GOODS searches. Moreover, this approach provides a strikingly more efficient
search-and-follow-up that is primarily pre-scheduled. The resulting dark
energy measurements do not share the major systematic uncertainty at these
redshifts, that of the extinction correction with a prior. By targeting
massive galaxy clusters at z > 1 we obtain a five-times higher	efficiency in
detection of Type Ia supernovae in ellipticals, providing a well-understood
host galaxy environment. These same deep cluster images then also yield
fundamental calibrations required for future weak lensing and
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements of dark energy, as well as an entire program
of cluster studies. The data will make possible a factor of two improvement on
supernova constraints on dark energy time variation, and much larger
improvement in systematic uncertainty. They will provide both a cluster
dataset and a SN Ia dataset that will be a longstanding scientific resource.

Title:	    Cepheid Calibrations of the Luminosity of Two Reliable Type Ia

PI:         Adam Riess

We propose to determine the luminosity of two type Ia supernovae {SNe Ia},
1995al in NGC 3021 and SN 2002fk in NGC 1309, by observing Cepheids in their
spiral hosts. Modern CCD photometry yields an extremely tight Hubble diagram
for SNe Ia with a precisely determined intercept {i.e., Delta H_0/H_0}. Yet,
the measurement of the true Hubble constant via SNe Ia is limited by the
calibration derived from problematic and unreliable SN data. Most of the SNe
Ia calibrated by HST to date are significantly compromised by the systematics
of photographic photometry, high reddening and SN peculiarity, and by the
photometric anomolies associated with WFPC2. The extended reach of ACS now
provides opportunities to more reliably calibrate SNe Ia and H_0. Our Cepheid
calibration of a reliable SN Ia dataset, SN 1994ae, using ACS in Cycle 11
resulted in a 15% increase in H_0 from the value derived by the HST SN Ia
Calibration Program. Yet, there remains a terribly small sample of reliable SN
Ia data sets on which to base such a crucial cosmological result. SN 1995al
and SN 2002fk are two of the best observed SNe Ia both with little reddening.
They provide two opportunities to use ACS for placing the calibration of H_0
via SN Ia on firmer footing and potentially improve its precision.

Modern supernovae searches in the nearby Universe are discovering large
numbers of SNe which 
have massive star progenitors {Types II, Ib and Ic}. The extensive HST image
archives within ~20Mpc
enables their indvidual bright stellar content to be resolved. As massive,
evolved stars are the most
luminous single objects in a galaxy, the progenitos of core-collapse SNe
should be directly detectable
on pre-explosion images. Two recent highlights of our ongoing HST programme
are that we have detected the first red supergiant progenitor of a normal type
II supernova and shown that SN1993J came from a binary system by detecting the
companion star at the position of the SN. We have detected a further two
progenitor stars of normal type II-P supernovae, set mass limits on a further
7 and suggest that faint
type II supernovae are unlikely to come from the collapse of very massive
stars which form black holes.
These discoveries are providing strong constraints on theoretical models of
pre-supernova evolution and 
the origin of the supernova types. We request time to continue this successful
project and require 
ACS observations of future SNe which are discovered in galaxies closer than
20Mpc which have 
pre-explosion HST archive images available. This will allow the SNe to be
precisely positioned on the
pre-explosion images. We have set a final goal for this project of determining
masses and types, or
setting restrictive mass-limits for 30 supernovae, before the demise of HST.

We propose to obtain a deep ACS/WFC mosaic of a protocluster comprised of 4
distinct galaxy groups that are gravitationally bound to each other at z=0.37.
The galaxy groups have a total combined mass comparable to the Coma cluster
and already have twice as many absorption line galaxies as the field. The
SG1120 complex thus provides an unprecedented opportunity for determining
whether "pre-processing" in the group environment is responsible for the bulk
of observed diffences between galaxies in nearby clusters and those in the
field. High resolution imaging with HST is needed to morphologically classify
the group members and measure their structural parameters. By combining the
early-type fraction and morphology-density relation in SG1120 with results
from our wide-field spectroscopic survey, we will test whether spectral and
morphological transformation timescales are decoupled on group scales and
isolate the environmental mechanisms responsible for such evolution. We will
also measure the Fundamental Plane and M/L ratios of the early-type members to
constrain their formation epoch and how their stellar populations have
evolved. Observations of the multiple galaxy groups in SG1120 provide a unique
dataset to the community and will aid our understanding of how galaxies evolve

Strongly interacting systems in the Local Universe offer the opportunity to
investigate the modality of star formation under dynamical conditions more
typical of the intermediate redshift Universe {z~0.5-1}, at an exquisite
resolution unmatched by distant galaxies.  M51 is one such system. Most
recently, the Hubble Heritage program dedicated 24 HST orbits to obtain a 3X2
ACS mosaic of M51 in BVI, and Halpha. While this is designed to produce a
lovely multi-color image of this photogenic target, its scientific return will
be limited for star formation studies. Hence we propose to augment these
observations by obtaining WFPC2 U band and NICMOS H band primary imaging {with
NICMOS Paschen alpha in parallel} of selected pointings of this interacting
galaxy system. At the modest cost of 14 additional orbits, we will: {1}
accurately determine the ages of the young star cluster population; {2} secure
the identification of 60-70 old globular clusters; {3} search for heavily dust
enshrouded stellar clusters; {4} investigate the distribution of the cluster
populations as a function of location {galactocentric, arms, interarms, etc.};
and {5} both remove the effects of dust and determine its properties. In
addition to our specific science goals, these observations lend themselves, on
their own or in synergy with data from GALEX and Spitzer, to a host of other
investigations, including those on evolved diffuse stellar populations,
galactic structure, and dust radiative transfer. We will thus release these

Title:	    ACS Imaging of the Uranus Aurora and Hydrogen Corona
PI:         John Clarke

ACS SBC UV observations of Uranus are proposed with dual purposes that can be
achieved with a single set of observations. First, we propose to observe the
very unusual auroral of Uranus for the first time since IUE and Voyager in the
1980's. The Uranus aurora are centered on the magnetic poles, corresponding to
the 60 deg. tilted magnetic moment, closer to the equator than the rotational
poles. The brighter auroral emission appears around the weaker magnetic pole.
The auroral emissions are highly variable, as recorded with IUE, and the
rotational phase of Uranus is not known. The observations will therefore cover
the extent of a Uranus rotation {17.29 hours}, and will be repeated one-half
solar rotation later to allow for variations in the solar wind at Uranus. The
high sensitivity of the ACS SBC at long wavelengths will increase the
sensitivity to auroral H2 emissions, and observations in cycle 14 near solar
minimum will limit the sky background and reflected solar emissions from the
Uranus disc. Secondly, these images will measure the extended hydrogen corona
of Uranus, first seen by the Voyager 2 UVS. We propose to model the
distribution of the hydrogen corona to determine the source processes in the
Uranus upper atmosphere, by comparison with model runs from an exospheric
code.

Title:	    The Star Formation Histories of Early Type Dwarf Galaxies in Low
	    Density Environments: Clues from the Sculptor Group
PI:         Gary Da Costa

We seek HST ACS/WFC time to conduct a detailed study of the stellar
populations of 5 early-type {dE,
dE/dIrr} dwarf galaxies in the nearby {~1.5 to 4 Mpc} Sculptor group.  Four of
these systems have been
recently found to contain modest amounts of HI, and existing ground-based and
HST snapshot data
point to the potential presence of small populations of young {blue} stars in
at least three of these systems.
Consequently, they resemble the Local Group 'transition' objects Phoenix and
LGS3.  The relative
number of such transition systems is thus substantially larger in the low
density environment of the Scl 
group than for the Local Group.  Detailed stellar populations studies will
allow estimation of the star 
formation histories, via stellar population modelling of the color-magnitude
diagrams, of the target dwarfs,
which in turn will connect to gas consumption and retention rates.  For the
two nearer dwarfs we aim to 
reach below the horizontal branch {a first for any  system beyond the Local
Group} equivalent to a main 
sequence turnoff age of ~1 Gyr.  The observations of these two systems will
also allow detection of 
RR Lyrae variables and thus direct confirmation of the presence of old
populations.   For the other three 
dwarfs will we cover the first 2.5 mags of the red giant branch, equivalent to
the main sequence termination 
for a ~300 Myr population.   The results will have implications for theories
of galaxy formation and evolution, 
particularly with regard to the evolutionary relation between low luminosity
dEs and dwarf irregulars.

Title:	    Characterizing the Sources Responsible for Cosmic Reionization
PI:         Richard Ellis

Our group has demonstrated the role that massive clusters, acting as powerful
cosmic lenses, can play in constraining the abundance and properties of
low-luminosity star-forming sources beyond z~6; such sources are thought to be
responsible for ending cosmic reionization.  The large magnification possible
in the critical regions of well-constrained clusters brings sources into view
that lie at or beyond the limits of conventional exposures such as the UDF, as
well as those in imaging surveys being undertaken with IRAC onboard Spitzer. 
We have shown that the combination of HST and Spitzer is particularly
effective in delivering the physical properties of these distant sources,
constraining their mass, age and past star formation history.  Indirectly, we
therefore gain a valuable glimpse to yet earlier epochs.  Recognizing the
result {and limitations} of the UDF exposure, we propose a systematic search
through 6 lensing clusters with ACS and NICMOS for further z~6-7 sources in
conjunction with existing deep IRAC data.  Our survey will mitigate cosmic
variance and extend the search both to lower luminosities and, by virtue of
the NICMOS/IRAC combination, to higher redshift.  The goal is to count and
characterize representative sources at z~6-10 and to delineate the redshift
range of activity for the planning of future observations.

Title:	    The Onset of Star Formation in the Universe: Constraints from
	    Nearby Isolated Dwarf Galaxies.
PI:         Carme Gallart

The details of the early star formation histories of tiny dwarf galaxies can
shed light on the role in galaxy formation of the reionization which occured
at high redshift. Isolated dwarfs are ideal probes since their evolution is
not complicated by environmental effects owing to the vicinity of the Milky
Way and M31. In addition, dwarf galaxies are the most common type of galaxies,
and potentially the building blocks of larger galaxies.  Since we can date the
oldest stars in them, their study represents a complementary approach to the
study of the formation and evolution of galaxies through high-z observations.
We propose to use the ACS to obtain a homogeneus dataset of high-quality
photometry, down to the old {13 Gyr} main-sequence turnoffs, for a
representative sample of 4 isolated Local Group dwarf galaxies. These data are
essential to unambiguously determine their early star formation histories,
through comparison with synthetic color-magnitude diagrams, and using the
constraints provided by their variable stars. Parallel WFPC2 observations of
their halos  will allow us to reveal the actual nature of their stellar
population gradients, providing important aditional constraints on their
evolution. The proposed observations are being complemented with ground-based
spectroscopy, to obtain metallicity and kinematic information. The
observations requested here, which must reach M_I=+3.5 {I=27.5-28.2} with
S/N=10 in crowded systems, can only be achieved with HST using ACS, and won't
be possible with planned ground- or space-based facilities such as JWST. Based
on deep WFPC2 observations and ACS image simulations, our team has designed an
observational strategy which carefully considers the optimal filter
combination, the necessary photometry depth and the effects of stellar
crowding.

Title:	    Coordinated observations of Saturn's auroral dynamic morphology
	    and Cassini plasma measurements
PI:         Jean-Claude Gerard

Planetary FUV aurora is the most spectacular signature of the electrodynamical
coupling between the solar wind, the planet's magnetic field, and its
atmosphere. Saturn's magnetosphere has similarities both with the Earth's
magnetosphere, which is 'open' to solar wind interaction and Jupiter's
relatively 'closed' case with its large internal sources of plasma. HST
observations of Saturn's aurora have shown a much more complex and dynamic
morphology than anticipated: a frequent 'spiral' structure, a changing size of
the oval in response to variations of the solar wind dynamics pressure, and
large brightness changes in a few ten of minutes following compression of the
magnetosphere by the solar wind. In addition, the global morphology and some
spots move at 70% of the planetary co-rotation, while some other features
appear nearly fixed in local time. Recently, ideas have emerged to account for
Saturn's aurora specificities, although many aspects are still not understood
due to the paucity of observational data. Electric current models suggest that
the main oval is located at the limit between closed and open magnetic field
lines, near the magnetopause. The availability of Cassini in Saturn's magnetic
environment now offers a unique opportunity for collaborative science. We thus
propose to test the relationship between the aurora and conditions at Saturn's
magnetopause {MP} boundary. We plan to image the FUV aurora with ACS at times
of inbound Cassini crossing of the MP from the upstream solar
wind/magnetosheath region into the middle magnetosphere during an inbound
segment of a Cassini's orbit. FUV images will also reveal whether the main
oval changes its size over the interval, possibly indicating evidence for
changes in the amount of open flux in the system. These HST images of the
aurora simultaneous with in situ measurements of the plasma characteristics
and electrodynamics inside the magnetosphere are critical to obtain key
observational tests and constraints to future ideas and models of Saturn's
auroral precipitation and magnetospheric processes involved.

Title:	    High resolution imaging of Jupiter's diffuse auroral emissions
	    inside and outside the main oval during solar minimum.
PI:         Denis Grodent

The analysis of HST-STIS FUV images has greatly and quickly advanced our
knowledge of the magnetospheric mechanisms producing the auroral emissions on
the giant planets. However, these studies were limited to the brightest
emissions and very little has been said about the fainter emissions, mainly
because of the lower S/N. We propose to image the faint auroral emissions on
Jupiter which could not be observed with STIS. We will take full advantage of
ACS/SBC's higher sensitivity to observe the diffuse auroral FUV emissions
appearing poleward and directly equatorward of Jupiter's main auroral oval in
the northern hemisphere. This proposal has the potential to reveal new
magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling mechanisms especially those involving solar
wind interactions with a giant planet.

PI:         Chris Kochanek

We will use deep ACS imaging of the giant {15 arcsec} four-image z_s=1.734
lensed quasar SDSS 1004+4112, and its z_l=0.68 lensing galaxy cluster, to
identify many additional multiply-imaged background galaxies. Combining the
existing single orbit ACS I-band image with ground based data, we have
definitely identified two multiply imaged galaxies with estimated redshifts of
2.6 and 4.3, about 15 probable images of background galaxies, and a point
source in the core of the central cD galaxy, which is likely to be the faint,
fifth image of the quasar. The new data will provide accurate photometric
redshifts, confirm that the candidate fifth image has the same spectral energy
distribution as the other quasar images, allow secure identification of
additional multiply-lensed galaxies for improving the mass model, and permit
identification of faint cluster members. Due to the high lens redshift and the
broad redshift distribution of the lensed background sources, we should be
able to use the source-redshift scaling of the Einstein radius that depends on
{d_ls/d_os}, to derive a direct, geometric estimate of Omega_Lambda. The
deeper images will also allow a weak lensing analysis to extend the mass
distribution to larger radii. Unlike any other cluster lenses, the time delay
between the lensed quasar images {already measured for the A--B images, and
measurable for the others over the next few years}, breaks the so-called
kappa-degeneracies that complicate weak-lensing analyses.

PI:         Marcella Longhetti

We ask for NICMOS-NIC2 H-band imaging of a sample of 10 massive early-type
galaxies spectroscopically identified at 1.2<z<1.7. Our aim is to look for
possible relics of merging events of their formation/evolution in their
morphology. The requested observations, sampling their rest-frame at
lambda>6500A, would map the mass distribution of the bulk of their stellar
content. The targets have been revealed by our group on the basis of near-IR
spectroscopy obtained in the framework of a spectroscopic survey of a complete
sample of bright EROs {Ks<18.5}. Optical and near-IR photometry is available
for all the targets, and low resolution near-IR spectra have allowed their
identification and redshift measurement. Spectroscopic and photometric data in
our hands show that they have already assembled stellar masses greater than 3
10^11 solar masses, and that the mean age of their stellar population is
estimated older than 2-3 Gyr for 6 of them and about 1 Gyr for the other 4
galaxies. Thus, they are among the most luminous and massive evolved galaxies
detected so far at z>1. Other data are needed to infer how they have assembled
such high stellar masses, i.e. to trace back their evolution. The requested
observations would allow us to reveal signs of past interaction/merger event.
A smooth r^{1/m} profile, coupled with no other signs of interaction/merger
{disturbed morphology}, would place the possible merger event of formation 1-2
Gyr before their redshift z pprox 1.5, i.e. at z > 2-3. On the other hand, if
signs of recent merger events will be found, the last merger event forming the
local massive spheroids will be constrained at 1.5 < z < 2. Thus, the
requested HST observations will allow for the first time to see how massive
early-type galaxies at z pprox 1.5 look like, constraining in any case the
redshift of the possible merging event of their formation.

We have recently discovered a young brown dwarf in the Taurus star-forming

type, forbidden emission lines, anomalous near-IR colors} that are often
observed in stars occulted by edge-on circumstellar disks. We propose to
determine if an edge-on disk is indeed present by obtaining high-resolution
images of this brown dwarf with ACS/HRC on HST. If the disk is detected, we
will constrain its physical properties, particularly its diameter, by fitting
the images with the predictions of our models of brown dwarfs occulted by
circumstellar disks. These observations could potentially provide the first
direct measurement of the size of a disk around a brown dwarf, which would
comprise a fundamental test of models for the formation of these objects
{e.g., embryo ejection}.

We propose an ambitious SNAPSHOT program to survey faint Jupiter Trojan
asteroids for binary companions. We target 150 objects, with the expectation
of acquiring data on about 50%. These objects span Vmag = 17.5-19.5, a range
inaccessible with ground-based adaptive optics. We now have a significant
sample from our survey of brighter Trojans to suggest that the binary fraction
is similar to that which we find among brighter main-belt asteroids, roughly
2%. However, our observations suggest a higher binary fraction for smaller
main-belt asteroids, probably the result of a different formation mechanism
{evident also from the physical characteristics of the binaries}. Because the
collision environment among the Trojans is similar to that of the Main Belt,
while the composition is likely to be very different, sampling the binary
fraction among the fainter Trojans should help us understand the collisional
and binary formation mechanisms at work in various populations, including the
Kuiper Belt, and help us evaluate theories for the origin of the Trojans.
Calibration of and constraints on models of binary production and collisional
evolution can only be done using these large-scale, real-life physical systems
that we are beginning now to find and utilize.

Title:	    The very late phases of a thermonuclear supernova
PI:         Peter Milne

A better understanding of the physics of Type Ia supernovae {SNe} is important
for their use as cosmological standard candles. Late time observations of the
SN light curves are poorly studied - but offers a unique way to probe the
explosion models. Combining state of the art models of 3-D explosions with
sophisticated spectral modeling, we can test these models against observations
in a way not earlier possible. In particular, the broad band light curves are
sensitive to the degree of clumping and the timing of the `infra-red
catastrophe', factors which depend on the explosion mechanism {deflagration
vs. delayed detonation}. Further, these observations can probe the degree of
positron trapping in the ejecta, important for both the SN ejecta and for the
production of free positrons in the galaxy. Because of its small distance,
favorable galaxy location and excellent ground based follow-up - SN 2003hv
offers a unique opportunity to obtain the best late light curves to date.
Observations in several optical and IR bands will enable us to distinguish
between different model predictions.

using the ACS/HRC that has a potential discovery efficiency an order of
magnitude higher than the HST observations that have already discovered the
majority of known transneptunian binaries.  By more than doubling the number
of observed objects in dynamically hot and cold subpopulations	we will be
able to answer, with statistical significance, the question of whether these
groups differ in the abundance of binaries as a result of their particular
dynamical paths into the Kuiper Belt.  Today's Kuiper Belt bears the imprints
of the final stages of giant-planet building and migration; binaries may offer
some of the best preserved evidence of that long-ago era.

Even with its long history as one of the pillars of modern astronomy, the

the past decade, numerous programs with HST have shown that extragalactic star
clusters powerfully probe the processes of galactic formation, evolution, and
destruction. The diversity of star cluster systems is a testament to the rich
variation in galaxy properties. During the course of the ACS Virgo Cluster
Survey, we have discovered that the early-type galaxy M85 has a system of star
clusters unlike any other galaxy studied to date. Hundreds of star clusters in
M85 are fainter and more extended than typical globular clusters, and have no
local analog. We propose deep optical-infrared imaging with ACS and NICMOS to
obtain ages, metallicities, luminosities, and sizes of unprecedented precision
to characterize these new star clusters and unravel the evolutionary state of
M85 that gave rise to them.

We propose to obtain unsaturated ACS high-resolution images of four

nuclear light from each image, thus yielding a "nucleus-free" image of the

particular interest is determination of the host-galaxy starlight contribution

determination of the relationship between the AGN nuclear continuum flux and
the size of the broad Balmer-line emitting regions of AGNs, which is important
because this relationship is used in estimating black hole masses for large
samples of QSOs, and {2} for accurate determination of the bolometric
luminosity of the AGN proper. In a Cycle 12 SNAP program, we obtained images

We propose to image the astrometrically discovered companions of three
M-dwarfs with NICMOS to more tightly constrain their masses and determine
their stellar or sub-stellar natures. Each of these systems has been observed
with a sensitive ground-based adaptive optics system and no companions have
been detected. NICMOS results will eliminate an ambiguity in the astrometric
mass measurements that arises because a companion that contributes
significantly to the visible light reduces the motion of the center of light
and mimics a small motion of the center of mass. In addition the astrometric
measurements made with NICMOS will fix the scale of the system, distinguishing
among possible orbits. Finally the color photometry will constrain the
spectral types to within a couple of subtypes. When we measure the masses of
astrophysical objects, we test and assist the development of the theoretical
mass models. Models are based upon parameters such as age and metallicity.
Determining the correct mass thus deepens our understanding of the fundamental

PI:         Janet Simpson

The importance of massive stars cannot be underestimated - they produce most
of the heavy elements in the universe and dominate the evolution of the
interstellar medium in their vicinity. In spite of their significance, our
understanding of their formation is meager. Both accretion through disks,
analogous to the process of low-mass star formation, and coalescence of
low-mass stars through collisions in the dense cores of stellar clusters have
been suggested. Possibly both mechanisms occur. High spatial resolution
polarization measurements of the closest massive young stellar objects {YSOs}
will enable us to search for evidence of disk accretion or coalescence in the
form of patterns indicative of light scattered off a coherent disk or off a
disk disrupted by an infalling star, respectively. Here we propose to use 2
micron polarimetry with NICMOS to identify the presence of accretion disks
around massive YSOs or to characterize their environments as possibly
disrupted from a close stellar encounter. There are only a few sources that
meet the stringent selection criteria for this investigation {even with HST},
which we will examine here. High spatial resolution is required, but even more
important, the point spread function {PSF} must be stable with time.
Furthermore, the PSF must put minimal flux into large spatial scales,
something that cannot be achieved with adaptive optics. This combination of
high Strehl ratio and stable PSF can only be achieved from space.

PI:         Tammy Smecker-Hane

Determining the star formation histories {SFHs} and chemical evolution of
nearby galaxies gives us powerful constrains on the physical processes that
regulate galaxy evolution. The SFHs can be measured most accurately by
comparing the observed densities of stars in color-magnitude diagrams {CMDs}
to predictions from stellar evolutionary models.  WFPC2 imaging of the Leo I
dSph shows it is unique because its stellar population is relatively young. 
Approximately 68% of its stars formed between 1 and 7 Gyr ago and only 12% of
its stars formed >~ 10 Gyr ago.  We propose to vastly improve the derived SFH
of Leo I by exploiting ACS/WFC's higher quantum efficiency at bluer
wavelengths,  higher spatial resolution, and larger field-of-view.  The figure
of merit for our proposed observations, defined as the age resolution times
the number of stars detected, will be a factor of 12 higher than existing
WFPC2 observations. To surmount the degeneracy of age and metallicity in the
CMD, we have independently measured the metallicity distribution of its stars
using spectroscopy. Simultaneously modeling the metallicity distribution and
CMD, we will firmly constrain the evolution of the Leo I dSph, a unique
example of an isolated dwarf galaxy that has not been influenced by
interactions with the Milky Way or M31.

We propose to observe the IRAC Dark Field, an extragalactic field 15
arcminutes in diameter near the north ecliptic pole, using 50 orbits of ACS
imaging at I-band. This field is extraordinarily deep and is uniquely suited
to detecting variable objects in the mid-infrared. The high spatial resolution
 ACS imaging will be used to derive morphological information about the
galaxies in the field, which will then be correlated with mid-infrared
variable objects {specifically AGN and supernovae} we have discovered.

This field is the dark current calibration target for the Spitzer Space
Telescope, the infrared counterpart to HST. Because the field is observed
frequently as part of routine operations, it is now similar in size and depth
to the infrared component of the GOODS program, and is confusion-limited in
the mid-infrared. More importantly, due to the periodicity of the
observations, the Spitzer observations are sensitive to variability on week
timescales, ultimately spanning a baseline of five years, and are the only
mid-infrared dataset that will ever have this capability at this depth. By
complementing our wide range of lower resolution imaging at optical and
infrared wavelengths, we hope to exploit one of HST's most unique capabilities
- unparalleled spatial resolution in the optical. While our specific interest
lies in analysis of variable sources, we will request no proprietary period on
the ACS data so that it may be used by the community to complement the

Stellar feedback - the return of mass and energy from star formation to the
interstellar medium - is one of the primary engines of galaxy evolution. Yet,
the theoretical foundation of mechanical feedback is, to date, unconstrained
by observations. We propose to investigate this fundamental aspect of star
formation on a sample of two local actively star-forming galaxies, NGC4449,
and Holmberg II. The two galaxies have been selected to occupy an unexplored,
yet crucial for quantifying mechanical feedback, niche in the two-parameter
space of star formation intensity and galaxy mass. ACS/WFC and WFPC2
narrow-band observations in the light of H-beta, [OIII], H-alpha, and [NII]
will be obtained for both galaxies, in order to: {1} discriminate the
feedback-induced shock fronts from the photoionization regions; {2} map the
shocks inside and around the starburst regions; and {3} measure the energy
budget of the star-formation-produced shocks. These observations, complemented
by existing data, will yield: {1} the efficiency of the feedback, i.e. the
fraction of the star formation's mechanical energy that is transported out of
the starburst volume rather than confined or radiated away; {2} the dependence
of this efficiency on the two fundamental parameters of star formation
intensity and stellar mass. The high angular resolution of HST is crucial for
separating the spatially narrow shock fronts {~5 pc, ~0.25" at 4 Mpc} from the
more extended photoionization fronts. The legacy from this project will be the
most complete quantitative measurement of the energetics associated with
feedback processes. We will secure the first milestone for placing feedback
mechanisms on a solid physical ground, and for understanding quantitatively
their role on the energetics, structure, and star formation history of

PI:         Roelof de Jong

We propose to resolve the stellar populations of the halos of seven nearby,
massive disk galaxies using a SNAP survey with WFC/ACS. These observations
will provide star counts and color-magnitude diagrams 2-3 magnitudes below
the tip of the Red Giant Branch along the two principal axes and one
intermediate
axis of each galaxy. We will measure the metallicity distribution functions
and
stellar density profiles from star counts down to very low average surface
brightnesses, equivalent to ~31 V-mag per square arcsec.

This proposal will create a unique sampling of galaxy halo properties, as our
targets cover a range in galaxy mass, luminosity, inclination, and
